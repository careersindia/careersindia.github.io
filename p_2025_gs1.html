                <h4>1. Answer: <strong>C</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
                Alternative powertrains-These are powertrains that are not based exclusively on the internal combustion engine. The main options include hybrids and plug-in hybrids, full battery electrics, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct.</strong> BEVs run solely on electricity stored in batteries and use electric motors for propulsion. They produce zero tailpipe emissions and are a major category under alternative powertrains.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is correct.</strong> FCEVs use a hydrogen fuel cell to generate electricity, which powers an electric motor. These vehicles are powered by hydrogen, not fossil fuels, and are also classified as alternative powertrain vehicles due to their zero-emission profile.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is correct.</strong> These are hybrid vehicles that combine a hydrogen fuel cell with an auxiliary power source like a battery or internal combustion engine. Since they use hydrogen-based propulsion as a primary source, they are also considered alternative powertrain vehicles.</p>
                <p>All 3 types (statements 1, 2, and 3) are correct. Hence, the number of alternative powertrain vehicles is 3.</p>

                <h4>2. Answer: <strong>D</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1: All types of UAVs can do vertical landing is incorrect.</strong><br>
                Only VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) UAVs – like multirotors and some hybrid fixed-wing drones – can perform vertical landings. Fixed-wing UAVs typically require a runway or catapult-based landing, and cannot perform vertical landings.</p>
                <p>Example of UAVs that <strong>can</strong> do vertical landing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>DJI Phantom 4 (Quadcopter) – Multirotor drone with VTOL capability.</li>
                    <li>WingtraOne (Hybrid VTOL) – Fixed-wing drone with vertical landing ability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example of UAVs that <strong>cannot</strong> do vertical landing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>RQ-4 Global Hawk (Fixed-wing) – Requires runway for take-off and landing.</li>
                    <li>Delair UX11 (Fixed-wing) – Needs a hand launch or catapult; lands by gliding.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Statement 2: All types of UAVs do automated hovering is incorrect.</strong></p>
                <p>UAVs that <strong>can</strong> hover:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>DJI Mavic Air (Quadcopter) – Hovers using onboard GPS and sensors.</li>
                    <li>AeryonSkyRanger (Rotorcraft) – Used for surveillance; can hover stably.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>UAVs that <strong>cannot</strong> hover:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bayraktar TB2 (Fixed-wing) – Needs forward movement; cannot stay stationary.</li>
                    <li>Predator MQ-1 (Fixed-wing) – Designed for long-endurance flights, no hovering.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Statement 3: All types of UAVs can use battery only as a source of power is incorrect.</strong></p>
                <p>Battery-powered UAVs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>DJI Mini 3 Pro – Lightweight drone with lithium-polymer battery.</li>
                    <li>Parrot Anafi – Uses a rechargeable battery for power.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Non-battery-powered UAVs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MQ-9 Reaper (Jet-fuel engine) – Runs on kerosene-based aviation fuel.</li>
                    <li>AeroVironment Global Observer – Uses liquid hydrogen fuel cell.</li>

                <h4>5. Answer: <strong>B</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
                Coal gasification is a process that converts coal into syngas (a mixture of CO, H₂, and CO₂). This syngas can then be used as a feedstock to produce various chemicals and fuels.</p>
                <p><strong>1. Ethanol – Yes:</strong> Ethanol can be synthesized indirectly from syngas via fermentation or catalytic conversion, particularly using processes like the thermochemical route or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Hence, coal gasification can contribute to ethanol production.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Urea – Yes:</strong> Urea is produced from ammonia and CO₂. Ammonia is synthesized using hydrogen (from syngas) and nitrogen (from air), and syngas from coal gasification is a major hydrogen source in this process. Therefore, coal gasification can be a starting point for urea production.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Nitroglycerine – No:</strong> Nitroglycerine is made by nitrating glycerol (a byproduct of biodiesel or soap production). Its production is not related to coal gasification or syngas pathways.</p>

                <h4>11. Answer: <strong>B</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement I is correct:</strong> The cement industry is a major source of CO2 emissions, contributing to more than 5% of global carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions come both from energy use (fossil fuel combustion) and from chemical decomposition of limestone (CaCO₃).</p>
                <p><strong>Statement II is correct but does not explain I:</strong> In cement production, silica-bearing clay is mixed with limestone to form the raw mix. However, this mixing process itself does not release CO₂, so it does not explain the emissions mentioned in Statement I. This combination forms the raw mix for cement production. Limestone provides the calcium carbonate, while clay adds silica, alumina, and iron oxide. This blend is then finely ground and proportioned to create the raw mix for cement production.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement III is correct and explains I:</strong> During clinker production, limestone (CaCO₃) is heated and decomposes into lime (CaO) and CO₂. CaCO₃→CaO+CO₂. This calcination process is the primary cause of carbon emissions in cement manufacturing, thus directly explaining Statement I.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> India refrained from signing the COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health, with sources pointing out that curbing greenhouse gas use for cooling in the health sector, which is one of the points in the document, may not be practical or achievable within the country's healthcare infrastructure in the short term.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong> The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health is a non-binding, non-negotiated call to action and collective commitment that reflects the concerns and common position of countries on the importance of health within climate discourse and in the COP process. It begins to articulate how climate-health is defined and how parties come together to address the urgent need for integrating climate and health.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong> It's not practical for India to curb greenhouse gases for cooling in the health sector because vaccines, drugs etc require cold storage rooms. “We need cold storages for storing vaccines and medicines and these are linked to making our healthcare systems resilient," Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests remarked, “However, suggestions that using these are contributing to climate emissions and that we must choose some fuels over the other are not acceptable."</p>

                <h4>13. Answer: <strong>B</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Days on Earth are growing slightly longer, and that change is accelerating. The reason is connected to the same mechanisms that also have caused the planet's axis to meander by about 30 feet (10 meters) in the past 120 years. The findings come from two recent NASA-funded studies focused on how the climate-related redistribution of ice and water has affected Earth's rotation.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong> Although solar flares, and associated coronal mass ejections, can bombard Earth's outermost atmosphere with tremendous amounts of energy, most of that energy is reflected back into space by the Earth's magnetic field. Because the energy does not reach our planet's surface, it has no measurable influence on surface temperature. Solar flares and coronal mass ejections do bombard the outer atmosphere, affecting communication, satellites, and sometimes auroras, but they do not cause Earth's axial shift.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong> This movement of water redistributes the Earth's mass, increasing the moment of inertia and slowing the planet's rotation, leading to slightly longer days. Scientists at ETH Zurich and other research groups have confirmed this effect. This redistribution of mass towards the equator affects Earth's moment of inertia and hence contributes to the shift in Earth's axis of rotation. This directly supports Statement I.</p>

                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Article 6 of the Paris Agreement enables international cooperation to tackle climate change and to unlock financial support for developing countries. There are three components to Article 6: Article 6.2, Article 6.4, and Article 6.8. Article 6 deals with cooperative approaches, carbon markets, and non-market mechanisms – a complex and widely debated issue in climate negotiations, particularly at COPs. Hence, it is frequently discussed in global forums.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong> Article 6.2 and 6.4 specifically outline how international carbon markets can be used to meet Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These allow for Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) and a Sustainable Development Mechanism.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong> Article 6.8 recognizes non-market approaches that support climate targets through capacity-building, finance, and technology transfer. These are intended to complement market mechanisms.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement I is explained by both II and III because:</strong> Article 6's relevance (carbon markets and non-market strategies) is precisely why it's frequently discussed in global climate forums.</p>

                <h4>19. Answer: <strong>B</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Pair 1 is correct:</strong> Cassava is a perennial woody shrub, specifically belonging to the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae). It is native to South America and now cultivated globally in tropical and subtropical regions. Cassava is mainly known for its edible root, a starchy tuberous root that is a significant source of carbohydrates.</p>
                <p><strong>Pair 2 is correct:</strong> Ginger is a herbaceous perennial plant with a unique structure featuring a pseudostem. Its leaves and stems are actually formed by overlapping leaf sheaths, creating a false stem that appears above ground. The true stem, a rhizome, is an underground horizontal stem that stores nutrients. This rhizome is what is commonly known as ginger root.</p>
                <p><strong>Pair 3 is correct:</strong> Malabar spinach (Basella alba) is a herbaceous, climbing plant. It is a perennial, meaning it can live for multiple years, and is often grown as an annual in colder climates. It's known for its fast growth and ability to climb, requiring a trellis or other support. Malabar spinach is a popular vegetable, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, and is known for its nutritional value and unique flavor.</p>
                <p><strong>Pair 4 is incorrect:</strong> Mint is a plant in the Lamiaceae family, and while some species can be annual, it's more common for mint to be a perennial herb. Mints are known for their aromatic leaves, square stems, and ability to spread through underground or overground runners (stolons).</p>
                <p><strong>Pair 5 is incorrect:</strong> While papaya is often called a tree, it's more accurately described as a short-lived, succulent, herbaceous plant. It has a single, non-woody stem that can grow up to 30 feet tall, and it lacks the true bark of a woody tree. It's also a perennial, meaning it lives for more than two years.</p>

                <h4>20. Answer: <strong>B</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is incorrect:</strong> Scientists estimate that roughly half of the oxygen production on Earth comes from the ocean. The majority of this production is from oceanic plankton – drifting plants, algae, and some bacteria that can photosynthesize. One particular species, Prochlorococcus, is the smallest photosynthetic organism on Earth. But this little bacteria produces up to 20% of the oxygen in our entire biosphere. That's a higher percentage than all of the tropical rainforests on land combined.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong> Phytoplankton contribute to nearly 50–80% of the global oxygen supply.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong> Oxygen content in air is much higher (21%) than in water (~0.001-0.008%).</p>

                Araghatta, also known as the Persian wheel or Rehat, is a traditional water-lifting device widely used for irrigation in India and other regions. This mechanical system operates by animal power, typically bullocks or buffaloes, which rotate a wheel fitted with buckets or pots to lift water from wells. The name "Araghatta" derives from the Sanskrit words ara (spoke) and ghatta (pot), describing the wheel's structure and water containers. Primarily employed to irrigate fields in areas with scarce water or low rainfall, Araghatta has historical roots dating back to medieval India.</p>

                Mahendravarman I, who ruled the Pallava kingdom from AD 600 to 630, is remembered as one of its greatest monarchs.

Besides being a skilled ruler, he was also an accomplished artist, musician and writer. His famous Sanskrit play Mattavilasa Prahasana (The Delightful Play of Drunken Sport) showcases his literary talent. His contributions were further continued by his son Narashimhavarman I.

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>I. Bonds</strong> - Not treated as Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). Bonds are traditional debt instruments, not classified under AIFs. Hence, point 1 is incorrect.</p>
                <p><strong>II. Hedge Funds</strong> – Treated as AIFs. In India, hedge funds come under Category III AIFs, which include complex or diverse strategies. Hence, point 2 is correct.</p>
                <p><strong>III. Stocks</strong> – Not AIFs. Stocks are conventional investment instruments traded on public exchanges. Hence, point 3 is incorrect.</p>
                <p><strong>IV. Venture Capital</strong> – Treated as AIFs. Venture capital funds are classified under Category I AIFs, which invest in start-ups and early-stage ventures. Hence, point 4 is correct.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>I is correct.</strong> The RBI earns income through buying and selling government bonds under open market operations. This includes interest income and capital gains.</li>
                    <li><strong>II is correct.</strong> The RBI earns from buying and selling foreign currency as part of its forex management, which can generate profits depending on exchange rate movements. It earns income through trading foreign currencies and investing the reserves in foreign assets (like U.S. Treasury bonds) which yield interest.</li>
                    <li><strong>III is incorrect.</strong> RBI does not manage pension funds for profit. Pension fund management is handled by separate bodies like PFRDA and EPFO.</li>
                    <li><strong>IV is incorrect.</strong> The RBI does not lend to private companies directly. It lends to commercial banks and the government.</li>
                    <li><strong>V is correct.</strong> Though printing notes is an expenditure, the <strong>seigniorage</strong> (difference between the face value of currency and the cost of printing it) is a significant source of income for the RBI.</li>

                <p><strong>Statement I is incorrect.</strong> Income from allied agricultural activities like poultry farming and wool rearing is not fully exempt from tax. Such activities are considered non-agricultural income and are taxable unless specifically exempted.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement II is correct.</strong> Under the Income-tax Act, rural agricultural land is not treated as a capital asset, meaning capital gains tax does not apply on its sale.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement I is correct.</strong> Bondholders face lower risk compared to stockholders because bonds typically have fixed returns and priority in repayment.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement II is correct.</strong> Bondholders lend money to the company (creditors), while stockholders own a part of the company (equity owners).</p>
                <p><strong>Statement III is correct.</strong> In case of repayment or liquidation, bondholders are paid before stockholders, thus reducing their risk.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Geological studies show that ancient rock formations along the eastern coast of South America (Brazil) closely correspond in type, age, and structure with those along the western coast of Africa. This matching of rock belts suggests these continents were once joined before drifting apart.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong> Rich placer gold deposits found in Ghana are believed to have originated from the Brazil plateau, indicating that these regions were once contiguous. The absence of local source rocks in Ghana and the similarity of gold-bearing veins in Brazil support this idea.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong> The distinctive Gondwana sedimentary deposits found in India have matching counterparts in Africa, Antarctica, Australia, South America, and Madagascar, indicating these landmasses were once part of the supercontinent Gondwana.</p>

                <h4>46. Answer: <strong>C</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Subtropical and temperate regions, especially those near deserts and arid zones such as the Sahara, Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia, and parts of the Middle East, have higher dust emissions due to dry soils and strong winds that lift dust into the atmosphere. In contrast, equatorial regions have dense vegetation and higher rainfall, which reduce dust emissions, and polar regions have ice and snow cover, limiting dust sources.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong> In fact, subtropical and temperate regions often experience strong dry winds, especially in desert and semi-arid zones, which are responsible for lifting and transporting dust particles. The presence of dry winds is a key factor contributing to the high dust content in these regions. Therefore, the claim that these areas have "less dry winds" is false.</p>

                <h4>47. Answer: <strong>A</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> The temperature over land is generally lower than over the oceans during winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The colder land causes the isotherms to bend towards the equator, while warmer oceans cause the isotherms to bend towards the poles.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong> Oceans have a higher heat capacity and cool down more slowly than land, so during the Northern Hemisphere winter, oceans remain relatively warmer compared to the land, which cools rapidly. Because the air over the oceans is warmer, the isotherms bend poleward over the oceans to reflect the higher temperatures. Conversely, over the colder landmasses, isotherms bend equatorward, indicating lower temperatures. Thus, the difference in temperature between land and ocean in January causes the characteristic bending of isotherms described in Statement I.</p>

                <h4>48. Answer: <strong>C</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Chalk typically has high permeability due to its porous structure, allowing water to pass through easily. Clay, on the other hand, has very low permeability because its particles are tightly packed, restricting water flow.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong> Chalk is a porous sedimentary rock with interconnected pore spaces that can absorb and transmit water. Porosity in chalk can be quite high, often ranging from about 25% to 40%, and its pore structure allows water to flow through it.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong> Clay does have porosity, but its pores are extremely small and poorly connected, which makes it impermeable or very low in permeability. Saying clay is "not at all porous" is inaccurate; it is porous but effectively impermeable due to pore size and connectivity.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> The Earth's atmosphere acts like a blanket, trapping heat through the natural greenhouse effect. Without this atmospheric layer, the Earth's surface would lose heat rapidly to space, causing average temperatures to plummet well below the freezing point of water. Estimates indicate the average surface temperature would be near -18°C (0°F) instead of the current average of about 15°C (59°F).</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong> The atmosphere absorbs solar radiation and traps outgoing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface, maintaining a stable average temperature suitable for life. This process is the greenhouse effect, primarily driven by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong> Carbon dioxide (CO₂), along with water vapor and other greenhouse gases, absorbs infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and re-radiates some of it back to the surface, effectively trapping heat.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>1. Revenue Deficit:</strong><br>
                Revenue Deficit = Revenue Expenditure - Revenue Receipts<br>
                = ₹80,000 crores - ₹60,000 crores = ₹20,000 crores. <strong>(Statement I is correct)</strong></p>
                <p><strong>2. Fiscal Deficit:</strong><br>
                Fiscal Deficit equals the total borrowings of the government.<br>
                Given Borrowings = ₹10,000 crores. So, Fiscal Deficit = ₹10,000 crores. <strong>(Statement II is correct)</strong></p>
                <p><strong>3. Primary Deficit:</strong><br>
                Primary Deficit = Fiscal Deficit - Interest Payments<br>
                = ₹10,000 crores - ₹6,000 crores = ₹4,000 crores. <strong>(Statement III is correct)</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> A wet-bulb temperature of 35°C is considered the upper physiological limit of human survival.

                To calculate the Gross Primary Deficit, we use the formula:<br>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement) processes transactions in real time, so settlement is instantaneous. NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) settles transactions in half-hourly or batch intervals, so there is a delay.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong> Banks do not charge customers for inward RTGS or NEFT transactions; charges, if any, are usually for outward transactions.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is incorrect:</strong> As per current RBI guidelines, both RTGS and NEFT are available 24x7, 365 days a year, including weekends and bank holidays.</p>

                <h4>81. Answer: <strong>C</strong></h4>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Since an Ordinance is equivalent to a Parliamentary law when in force, it can amend, repeal, or modify an existing Central Act. There is no legal restriction stopping an Ordinance from altering laws already passed by Parliament.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong> According to Article 13(2) of the Constitution, the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges Fundamental Rights. Ordinances are considered ‘law' under Article 13(3)(a) and therefore cannot abridge Fundamental Rights.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong> Ordinances, like Parliamentary laws, can have retrospective effect, i.e., they can be made effective from a date prior to the date of promulgation. This is not prohibited under the Constitution, provided it does not violate Fundamental Rights.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
                In 1930, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Civil Disobedience Movement by breaking the Salt Law. He undertook the historic Dandi March, and on April 6, 1930, he picked up natural salt from the seashore, symbolically defying British rule. During this time, Gandhi gave a bold and defiant statement: "Sedition has become my religion." He was emphasizing that resisting unjust colonial laws had become a sacred duty for him.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
                The Poona Pact was signed in 1932 between Gandhiji and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. It was related to separate electorates for the Depressed Classes proposed in the Communal Award. Gandhiji strongly opposed the idea, fearing it would divide Hindu society. While in jail, he went on a fast unto death, and the resulting compromise was the Poona Pact. After this event, Gandhiji intensified his efforts for the upliftment of the Depressed Classes, whom he called Harijans (meaning "Children of God").</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Anadyr (Siberia, Russia) and Nome (Alaska, USA) are close geographically but fall on opposite sides of the International Date Line (IDL). Anadyr is in Russia's Far East Time Zone (UTC+12) and Nome is in Alaska Standard Time (UTC-9). This creates a 21-hour time difference. When it's morning in Anadyr on a Monday, it's still the previous day (Sunday) in Nome.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2 is incorrect:</strong> Anadyr is ahead of Nome in time (by 21 hours). So, when it's Monday in Anadyr, it would still be <strong>Sunday</strong> in Nome, not Tuesday.</p>
