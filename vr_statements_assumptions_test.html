        <!-- Theory Section -->
        <section id="theory">
            <h2>1. Theory: About Statement and Assumptions</h2>
            <p><strong>Statement and Assumptions</strong> is a type of verbal reasoning question that tests a candidate's ability to identify the unstated or hidden ideas behind a given statement. An assumption is something that is supposed or taken for granted before making a statement.</p>
            <p>In competitive exams, you are given a statement followed by two or more assumptions. You must decide which of the assumptions are 'implicit' in the statement. An assumption is implicit if it directly follows from the statement, aligns with the author's intent, and is a necessary belief for the statement to be meaningful.</p>

            <h3>Core Techniques & Approach</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Understand the Statement:</strong> Read the statement carefully and identify its core message, tone (advisory, factual, advertisement, etc.), and context.</li>
                <li><strong>What is an Assumption?:</strong> An assumption is the hidden belief of the speaker/author. Ask yourself, "What must the author have believed to be true to make this statement?" The assumption is the 'why' behind the 'what' (the statement).</li>
                <li><strong>The Implicit Test:</strong> An assumption is implicit if the statement cannot hold its ground without it. If the assumption is negated (proven false), the statement should become illogical or pointless.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Restatements and Conclusions:</strong> An assumption is not a mere rephrasing of the statement, nor is it a conclusion drawn from it. It's the foundation upon which the statement is built.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch for Keywords:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Words like "all," "only," "each," "every," "definitely," "best" make an assumption strong and often invalid. Assumptions should be more general.</li>
                        <li>Words like "some," "many," "to an extent" often make an assumption valid.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Common Types of Valid Assumptions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cause and Effect:</strong> If a statement suggests an action, the assumption is that there is a cause that necessitates it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution/Course of Action:</strong> If a statement is a solution (notice, advertisement, appeal), the assumption is that the problem exists and that people will respond to the solution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Existence of the Subject:</strong> The subject of the statement is assumed to exist and be relevant.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

                <h4>Difficulty Level 1: Easy (Questions 1-10)</h4>
                <p>These questions involve straightforward statements like advertisements, notices, and simple advice.</p>
            </div>
            <ol>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 1:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> A notice on a shop reads, "25% discount on all items."<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. People will be attracted to the shop because of the discount.<br>II. The shop owner will still make a profit after giving the discount.</p><div class="assumption-options"><p>A) Only assumption I is implicit<br>B) Only assumption II is implicit<br>C) Both I and II are implicit<br>D) Neither I nor II is implicit</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both I and II are implicit</p><h4>Diagram (Author's Logic)</h4><div class="diagram-box">
Assumption: People want discounts & the business needs to be viable.
     ||
     \/
Statement: "25% discount on all items."
     ||
     \/
Intended Result: More customers will come and the shop will still earn.
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p><strong>Technique:</strong> Analyze the purpose of the statement. This is an advertisement.
<br><strong>Assumption I:</strong> The primary purpose of offering a discount is to attract customers. The owner believes people will respond positively. So, I is implicit.
<br><strong>Assumption II:</strong> A business operates to make a profit. It is a general assumption that a shopkeeper will not sell items at a loss unless it's a clearance sale (which isn't mentioned). Thus, the assumption that some profit will be made is implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 2:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> "Please use the foot-over bridge to cross the road." - A notice by the traffic police.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. People may not use the foot-over bridge.<br>II. People are capable of reading the notice and using the bridge.</p><div class="assumption-options"><p>A) Only I is implicit<br>B) Only II is implicit<br>C) Both I and II are implicit<br>D) Neither I nor II is implicit</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both I and II are implicit</p><h4>Diagram (Author's Logic)</h4><div class="diagram-box">
Assumption: People are currently not using the bridge, but they can read and are physically able to use it if requested.
     ||
     \/
Statement: "Please use the foot-over bridge..."
     ||
     \/
Intended Result: People will read the notice and start using the bridge for safety.
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p><strong>Technique:</strong> Analyze the reason for the notice.
<br><strong>Assumption I:</strong> A notice or request is only given if the desired action is not happening automatically. The police put up the notice because they assume some people might be crossing the road directly. So, I is implicit.
<br><strong>Assumption II:</strong> The police put up the notice believing that people will be able to read it and are physically capable of climbing and using the bridge. If they assumed otherwise, the notice would be pointless. So, II is implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 3:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The government has decided to increase the tax on cigarettes.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. The government will earn more revenue from this decision.<br>II. People will reduce smoking due to the price increase.</p><div class="assumption-options"><p>A) Only I is implicit<br>B) Only II is implicit<br>C) Both I and II are implicit<br>D) Either I or II is implicit</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> D) Either I or II is implicit</p><h4>Diagram (Author's Logic)</h4><div class="diagram-box">
Assumption: Increasing the price will have a financial or health impact.
     ||
     \/
Statement: Government increases tax on cigarettes.
     ||
     \/
Possible Results: (1) Revenue increases OR (2) Consumption decreases.
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p><strong>Technique:</strong> Consider the dual objectives of such government policies.
<br>The government can have two main motives for increasing tax on a "sin good" like cigarettes:
<br>1. To increase revenue (Assumption I).
<br>2. To discourage consumption for health reasons (Assumption II).
<br>These two assumptions are somewhat contradictory. If people drastically reduce smoking (II is very effective), revenue might not increase significantly (I becomes less effective). If people continue smoking despite the high price (II is ineffective), revenue will certainly increase (I is effective). The government hopes for at least one of these outcomes, making the situation an "Either/Or" case. The government assumes its action will be effective in at least one of these ways.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 4:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> A coaching institute's advertisement: "Join us to get 100% success in the banking exam."<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. Students want success in the banking exam.<br>II. This is the only institute that provides success.</p><div class="assumption-options"><p>A) Only I is implicit<br>B) Only II is implicit<br>C) Both I and II are implicit<br>D) Neither I nor II is implicit</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) Only I is implicit</p><h4>Diagram (Author's Logic)</h4><div class="diagram-box">
Assumption: There is a demand for success in banking exams.
     ||
     \/
Statement: "Join us to get 100% success..."
     ||
     \/
Intended Result: Students seeking success will join the institute.
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p><strong>Technique:</strong> Identify the target audience and avoid extreme assumptions.
<br><strong>Assumption I:</strong> The advertisement targets students who are aspiring for banking exams. It assumes that there is a demand and students desire success. This is a valid, implicit assumption.
<br><strong>Assumption II:</strong> The statement is an advertisement, which often involves exaggeration. However, assuming it is the "only" such institute is too extreme and not necessary for the statement to be made. Other institutes can exist. Therefore, II is not implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 5:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The municipal corporation has advised residents to use boiled water for drinking purposes.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. There is a risk of waterborne diseases in the city.<br>II. Boiled water is completely safe for drinking.</p><div class="assumption-options"><p>A) Only I is implicit<br>B) Only II is implicit<br>C) Both I and II are implicit<br>D) Neither I nor II is implicit</p></div><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both I and II are implicit</p><h4>Diagram (Author's Logic)</h4><div class="diagram-box">
Assumption: There is a problem (water contamination) and there is a reliable solution (boiling water).
     ||
     \/
Statement: "Use boiled water for drinking."
     ||
     \/
Intended Result: Residents will boil water and avoid getting sick.
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p><strong>Technique:</strong> Analyze the reason behind the advisory.
<br><strong>Assumption I:</strong> An advisory to take a precaution is only issued if there is a perceived threat or problem. The corporation must believe there's a risk of contamination. So, I is implicit.
<br><strong>Assumption II:</strong> The corporation is recommending boiling water as a solution. It must assume that this solution is effective and safe. If they didn't believe boiled water was safe, they wouldn't recommend it. So, II is implicit.</p></div></details></li>

                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 6:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> "Let us increase the security in the university campus." - The Vice Chancellor to the Registrar.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. The existing security is not sufficient.<br>II. Increasing security will improve the situation.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both I and II are implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. A call to "increase" something implies that the current level is considered inadequate. Implicit.<br>II. A suggestion for action is made with the belief that it will be effective and lead to an improvement. Implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 7:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The school has decided to provide free breakfast to all students to improve attendance.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. Lack of breakfast is a reason for poor attendance.<br>II. All students will like the breakfast provided.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) Only assumption I is implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The school is implementing a solution (free breakfast) to a problem (poor attendance). They must assume there is a link between the two. Implicit.<br>II. The assumption that "all" students will like it is too strong. The school only needs to assume that the offer is attractive enough to improve attendance, not that everyone will love the food. Not implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 8:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The state government has decided to provide a monthly unemployment allowance to all unemployed youth.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. The government has enough funds to provide the allowance.<br>II. This step will eliminate unemployment.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) Only assumption I is implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. A government deciding to implement a financial scheme must assume it has the funds to do so. This is a practical and necessary assumption. Implicit.<br>II. The allowance is a form of support, not a job. It aims to help the unemployed, not "eliminate" unemployment itself. This is a conclusion or a hope, not a core assumption. Not implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 9:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> A's advice to B: "If you want to study Management, join IIM."<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. IIM provides good Management education.<br>II. B will listen to A's advice.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both I and II are implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. One recommends something based on the belief in its quality. A must assume IIM is a good institute for Management. Implicit.<br>II. One gives advice with the hope and assumption that the other person will consider and possibly follow it. If A thought B would definitely not listen, the advice would be pointless. Implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 10:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> "Invest in our mutual fund for a secure future." - An advertisement.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. People want a secure future.<br>II. Mutual funds are the only way to secure the future.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) Only assumption I is implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. Advertisements appeal to the desires and needs of the target audience. The ad assumes people desire a secure future. Implicit.<br>II. The word "only" makes this assumption too extreme. The ad promotes one way to a secure future, not the sole way. Not implicit.</p></div></details></li>

                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 11:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The railway authority has decided to add more coaches to the train running between City A and City B.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. The existing number of coaches is not sufficient for the number of passengers.<br>II. The new coaches will be available.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both I and II are implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The decision to add more coaches is a solution to a problem, which must be overcrowding. Implicit.<br>II. An authority cannot decide to implement a solution without assuming that the resources (new coaches) are available or can be made available. Implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 12:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> "The impact of this economic policy will be seen after five years." - A minister.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. The economic policy will not be reviewed or changed for the next five years.<br>II. The effects of an economic policy are not instantaneous.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> B) Only assumption II is implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. This is too strong. The policy might be reviewed, but the main impact is still expected after five years. Not implicit.<br>II. The statement itself suggests a time lag. The minister must believe that the effects are gradual and take time to manifest. Implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 13:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The company has rejected candidate X for the post of Manager, even though he has the required qualifications, as he demanded a very high salary.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. The company can find other candidates with similar qualifications at a lower salary.<br>II. The salary demanded by candidate X is beyond the company's budget for the post.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both I and II are implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. A company would not reject a qualified candidate for a high salary unless they believed they could find a suitable alternative for less. Implicit.<br>II. The reason for rejection is the "very high salary". This implies the demanded amount is not feasible for the company, either due to budget constraints or because it's higher than what they are willing to pay. Implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 14:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The performance of student 'A' this year was brilliant, and he is eligible for the 'Best Student' award.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. There are other students who are not as brilliant as 'A'.<br>II. The performance of student 'A' was not so brilliant in the past.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) Only assumption I is implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The concept of "Best Student" implies a comparison. To call someone the best, it's assumed there are others to compare against who performed less brilliantly. Implicit.<br>II. The statement only talks about "this year". It gives no information about the past. Making an assumption about the past is not valid. Not implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 15:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> Despite the traffic jam, I reached the office on time.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. Traffic jams usually cause delays.<br>II. I do not usually come late to the office.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> A) Only assumption I is implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. The word "despite" indicates that the traffic jam was an obstacle that was expected to cause a delay. The speaker is surprised or pleased to have overcome this expected delay. Implicit.<br>II. The statement is a specific instance and does not provide enough information to make a general assumption about the person's usual punctuality. Not implicit.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 16:</strong><br><strong>Statement:</strong> The principal has announced that all students must attend a special seminar on Saturday.<br><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br>I. Some students might not attend the seminar otherwise.<br>II. The seminar is for the benefit of the students.</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) Both I and II are implicit</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>I. Making something "must" or mandatory implies that voluntary attendance might be low. Implicit.<br>II.

The manager *hopes* or *expects* all employees to be available, but doesn't necessarily *assume* they will all be there (some could be on leave). This is more of a hope than a core assumption.<br>II. The word "urgent" directly implies that the manager believes the matter is important and requires immediate attention. Implicit.</p></div></details></li>
