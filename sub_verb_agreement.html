                <h2>What is Subject-Verb Agreement (SVA)?</h2>

                        <li>A **singular subject** takes a **singular verb**. (e.g., A verb with an '-s' ending in the present tense)</li>
                        <li>A **plural subject** takes a **plural verb**. (e.g., The base form of the verb in the present tense)</li>

                </div>
