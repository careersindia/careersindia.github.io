        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which diagram best represents the relationship between: <strong>Minutes, Days, Months</strong>?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Option D</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> This relationship is a clear hierarchy. Minutes are a part of Days, and Days are a part of Months. Therefore, the diagram must show three nested circles: a small circle for "Minutes" inside a larger circle for "Days," which is inside the largest circle for "Months."</p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which diagram best represents the relationship between: <strong>Dogs, Pets, Cats</strong>?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Option B</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> "Pets" is the main, larger category. Dogs and Cats are types of animals that can be pets. A dog cannot be a cat, so their circles must be separate. In this context, both "Dogs" and "Cats" are considered as subsets of "Pets." The correct diagram shows two separate, non-overlapping circles (Dogs and Cats) that are both completely contained within a larger circle (Pets).</p>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 3</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which diagram best represents the relationship between: <strong>Table, Chair, Furniture</strong>?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Option C</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> "Furniture" is the overarching category. Both "Table" and "Chair" are types of furniture, so their circles must be inside the "Furniture" circle. However, a table is not a chair, so their individual circles must be separate from each other. The diagram shows two separate circles contained entirely within a larger one.</p>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 4</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which diagram best represents the relationship between: <strong>Males, Fathers, Brothers</strong>?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Option A</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> "Males" is the largest category that contains the other two. All fathers are male, and all brothers are male. A person can be both a father and a brother at the same time (e.g., a man who has a child and also a sibling). Therefore, the "Fathers" and "Brothers" circles must overlap with each other, and both must be completely inside the "Males" circle.</p>

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 5</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which diagram best represents the relationship between: <strong>Females, Mothers, Doctors</strong>?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Option A</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The relationship is as follows: All "Mothers" are "Females," so the "Mothers" circle must be entirely inside the "Females" circle. The "Doctors" category is separate. Some doctors are female, and some are not. Some doctors who are female are also mothers. Therefore, the "Doctors" circle must overlap with both the "Females" circle and the smaller "Mothers" circle inside it.</p>
