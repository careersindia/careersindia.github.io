        <h1>Verbal Reasoning - Statement & Conclusion</h1>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> To be a good singer, one must have a good voice. Anu is not a good singer.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> Anu does not have a good voice.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> Anu has a bad voice.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Neither Conclusion 1 nor 2 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The statement establishes a necessary condition (Good Singer → Good Voice), not a sufficient one. Just because Anu is not a good singer, we cannot conclude she lacks a good voice; she might be missing other skills like rhythm or training. "Not good" also does not automatically mean "bad." Therefore, neither conclusion can be definitively derived.</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Soldiers serve their country.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> Men who serve their country are soldiers.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> Women do not serve their country because they cannot be soldiers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Neither Conclusion 1 nor 2 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The statement implies that if someone is a soldier, they serve their country. It does not mean the reverse is true; many other professionals (doctors, teachers) also serve their country. Conclusion 2 introduces gender bias and information not present in the statement, making it invalid.</p>
        </div>
        
        <hr>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 3</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> All students in my class are intelligent. Sahil is not intelligent.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> Sahil is not a student of my class.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> Sahil must study.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Only Conclusion 1 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The statement can be logically read as: If someone is a student in my class, then they are intelligent. The contrapositive is: If someone is not intelligent, then they are not a student of my class. Since we are told "Sahil is not intelligent," it directly follows that he is not a student of that class. Conclusion 2 is an advice, not a logical deduction from the given facts.</p>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 4</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> In a one-day cricket match, the total runs made by a team were 200. Out of these, 160 runs were made by spinners.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> 80% of the team consists of spinners.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> The opening batsmen were spinners.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Neither Conclusion 1 nor 2 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The statement is about the source of the *runs*, not the composition of the *team*. Scoring 80% of the runs doesn't mean 80% of the players are spinners. Furthermore, we have no information about when these runs were scored, so we cannot conclude that the openers were spinners.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 5</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> The old order changed, yielding place to new.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> Change is the law of nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> Discard old ideas because they are old.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Only Conclusion 1 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> Conclusion 1 is a universal truth that encapsulates the essence of the statement. The statement itself is an example of this natural law. Conclusion 2 provides a reason ("because they are old") that is not mentioned in the statement. The statement says change happens, but doesn't specify why, so Conclusion 2 is an invalid assumption.</p>
        </div>
        
        <hr>
        
        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 6</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Parents are prepared to pay any price for an elite education for their children.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> All parents these days are very well off.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> Parents have an obsessive passion for the perfect development of their children through good schooling.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Only Conclusion 2 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> Being "prepared to pay" signifies a strong desire or willingness, not necessarily the financial capacity. Therefore, Conclusion 1 is an incorrect generalization. The phrase "pay any price" strongly implies a deep-seated passion and desire for their children's educational development, making Conclusion 2 a valid interpretation of the statement's sentiment.</p>

        <!-- Question 7 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 7</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> The government has decided to disinvest its shares in some public sector undertakings. This is because the PSUs are running at a loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> The government will sell its shares *only* in the companies that are running at a loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> The government will *not* sell its shares in profit-making companies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Neither Conclusion 1 nor 2 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The statement gives a reason for a specific action (disinvesting in *some* PSUs) but doesn't claim this is the only condition for disinvestment. The word "only" in Conclusion 1 makes it too restrictive. Similarly, we cannot conclude that profit-making companies will not be considered for disinvestment in the future for other reasons.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 8 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 8</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Mr. X is one of the probable candidates shortlisted for the post of director of KLM institute.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> Mr. X will be selected as the director of KLM institute.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> Mr. X will not be selected as the director of KLM institute.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Either Conclusion 1 or 2 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The word "probable" means there is a possibility of selection, but it is not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively say he *will* be selected (Conclusion 1 is uncertain). Likewise, we cannot definitively say he *will not* be selected (Conclusion 2 is uncertain). Since only one of these two outcomes can occur, it is a classic "Either/Or" case.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 9 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 9</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> All the people in Kerala are literate.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> The people in Kerala are educated and cultured.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> All the people in Kerala are employable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Neither Conclusion 1 nor 2 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> "Literate" means having the ability to read and write. Being "educated and cultured" or "employable" are much broader concepts that are not directly and universally concluded from literacy alone. These conclusions are outside the scope of the information given.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 10 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 10</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Fortune favors the brave.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 1:</strong> Cowards die many times before their death.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion 2:</strong> Risk is necessary for success.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Only Conclusion 2 follows.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> Conclusion 1 is a separate, unrelated proverb. Conclusion 2, however, captures the essence of the statement. Being "brave" implies a willingness to take risks, and "fortune" implies success or positive outcomes. Therefore, the statement logically concludes that taking risks is a necessary component of achieving success.</p>
