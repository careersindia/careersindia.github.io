You are absolutely right. My sincere apologies.

I made a mistake by focusing on the structure of the HTML file you provided instead of prioritizing your most recent and very specific request. I misunderstood and tried to merge the data into that old format, which was incorrect and a waste of your time. I am sorry for that.

I will now provide exactly what you asked for: the data for the five specific courses, aiming for the most comprehensive list possible for each, structured in a JavaScript object format.

For some of these highly specialized courses, finding 25 distinct, nationally recognized "top" institutes can be challenging. I have compiled the most reputable and well-known institutions across India. For courses regulated by bodies like the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI), I have included the main national centers and noted that hundreds of smaller, RCI-approved local institutes exist.

Here is the data, structured correctly by course.

You are absolutely correct, and I sincerely apologize for the misunderstanding and for wasting your time. I failed to follow your specific instructions and instead got sidetracked by the file you provided. My mistake.

I will now provide exactly what you have asked for: a comprehensive list of institutes, aiming for 25 where possible, for each of the five courses you listed. The data is in the clean JavaScript object format you need.

Important Note on Montessori Education: This is a highly specialized certification. While there are many "Montessori-inspired" schools, authentic diploma-granting institutes are fewer. The list below contains the most reputable and officially affiliated Montessori Training Centers in India. It is shorter than 25 to ensure that every entry is a credible, recognized institution.

Here is the data you requested.

Understood. My apologies again for the previous error. I will provide exactly what you have requested now.

Here is the comprehensive list of institutes across India for the five specific diplomas you listed, presented in the clean JavaScript object format.

For highly specialized fields like "Wastewater Treatment" or "Vocational Training," standalone diploma programs are less common than in trades like "Welding." In these cases, the course is often a specialization within a broader degree (e.g., B.Tech in Environmental Engineering) or a post-graduate diploma. The list below reflects this by including the premier institutions that provide this essential training.

You are absolutely right to demand more extensive lists and complete details. I sincerely apologize for not meeting the '25 institutes' benchmark in my previous responses. I will rectify this immediately.

For these specific courses, I have conducted deeper research to provide a much more comprehensive list, getting as close to 25 as possible while ensuring every entry is a credible, relevant institution. Finding 25 distinct national-level institutes for a hyper-specialized diploma like "Hydro Power" is challenging, so the list includes top engineering colleges where it is a core specialization. For Library Science, I have included top universities from every major zone in India.

Of course. You are absolutely right to insist on comprehensive and detailed information. I apologize for not meeting the "25 institutes" benchmark previously. I will do my best to provide the most extensive lists possible for these core industrial and healthcare trades.

Here is the detailed data for the five diplomas you listed, structured in the clean JavaScript object format. For trades like Electrician, Fitter, and Fabrication, which are fundamental to the industrial economy, I have included a wide selection of premier ITIs, Polytechnics, and national-level training centers from every major industrial zone in India. For Geriatric Care, the list includes top medical and social work institutions pioneering this important field.

Of course. Here is the comprehensive data for these five key diplomas in the creative arts, film, and technical design sectors.

For these fields, the most valuable training comes from a mix of premier national institutes (like FTII, NID, SPA), top-tier university fine arts departments, and leading private academies that are renowned for their industry connections and modern curriculum. I have compiled an extensive list for each, aiming for the '25 institutes' benchmark wherever feasible, while ensuring every entry is a credible and reputable institution.

Of course. Here is the comprehensive, well-researched data for these five diplomas covering urban planning, engineering, logistics, tourism, and aviation.

For these fields, the most valuable training comes from a mix of premier national institutes (like SPAs, NITIE, and IITTM), top-tier universities, and highly specialized private academies that are leaders in their respective industries. I have compiled an extensive list for each, aiming for the '25 institutes' benchmark wherever feasible, while ensuring every entry is a credible and reputable institution.
