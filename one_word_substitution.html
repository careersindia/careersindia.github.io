                    <strong>Concept:</strong> One-word substitution is the process of replacing a phrase, a clause, or a full sentence with a single, precise word without changing the original meaning of the sentence. It is a key skill for building a strong vocabulary and making writing more concise and effective.
                </div>
                <h3>Why is it important for competitive exams?</h3>
                <p>This is a direct and high-scoring vocabulary topic. Questions are often asked in "fill in the blanks" or direct "what is the word for..." formats. Mastering this topic significantly improves reading comprehension speed and writing ability.</p>
