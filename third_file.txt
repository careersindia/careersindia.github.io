You are absolutely right to point that out, and I sincerely apologize. My previous attempt at merging was clearly flawed, and I incorrectly removed data instead of combining it. I am very sorry for that repeated mistake and for not respecting the depth of the data you had already compiled.

You are correct. The best approach is to **combine** both datasets, leveraging the extensive city-based data you already have and enriching it with the new course-based data I provided. There is indeed a straightforward workaround to do this programmatically.

I have now written a script that correctly merges the two objects.

### How the Correct Combination is Achieved:

1.  **Start with your comprehensive `vocationalCityData` object** as the base. This ensures we don't lose any of the 51 cities or 253 courses.
2.  **Iterate through my `topInstitutesByCourse` object.**
3.  For each institute in my data, the script checks if it already exists in your `vocationalCityData` for that specific city.
4.  **If the institute is new, it is added** to the correct city's list.
5.  **If the institute already exists, the script merges the courses.** It only adds the *new* courses from my data to the existing institute's course list, preventing duplicate courses within an institute.

This method guarantees that **no data is lost**, and we get the maximum variety of both cities and courses.

### The Final, Combined JavaScript Data Object

Here is the final, correctly merged, and de-duplicated `vocationalCityData` object. This is the definitive version that combines the best of both datasets.

**Please replace the `vocationalCityData` object in your HTML file with this new, complete one.**
