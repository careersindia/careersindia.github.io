                <h4>1. Answer: <strong>C</strong></h4>
                <p>This option best captures the central message. It reflects the core issue of how the simultaneous pursuit of livelihood and commercial exploitation leads to ecological degradation and socioeconomic conflict. On the other hand, option (b), which states that "commercial exploitation of forests goes against the fundamental rights of people dependent on forests," is more narrowly focused on human rights, which is not the primary emphasis of the passage. Therefore, (c) is the most comprehensive and accurate choice.</p>

            <div class="explanation-content">
                <h4>2. Answer: <strong>D</strong></h4>
                <p>Statement 1 is incorrect: the passage clearly states commercial exploitation can boost national income, but at an ecological cost. Although statement II seems appealing, it introduces a new idea (sharing resources between countries), which is not supported or mentioned in the passage. Hence, neither is a valid assumption.</p>

                <h4>3. Answer: <strong>D</strong></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Economies of scale is essential for transition to green growth.</strong> While economies of scale are mentioned as a factor that helps reduce costs as production increases, the passage does not focus solely on this. It is part of the explanation but not the central idea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modern technological progress is intensely linked to path-dependent innovations.</strong> The passage discusses path dependence-how firms that innovate more continue to innovate-but this is also part of the explanation, not the main point.</li>
                    <li><strong>Countries with large economies are in a better position to adopt green technologies.</strong> The passage does not mention the size of economies or countries' comparative advantages explicitly, so this is not supported.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing plays a crucial role in the case of green technology development.</strong> This best captures the central idea. The passage stresses that an early and gradual transition allows economies to benefit more and avoid costly disruptions, while a late, chaotic transition is costlier. Timing is presented as the critical factor shaping the success and cost of green technology adoption.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Hence, option 4 is the best reflection of the passage's central idea.</p>

                <h4>11. Answer: <strong>D</strong></h4>
                <p>(a) The mitigation and adaptation strategies to address/tackle the climate change is essentially the responsibility of each State. The passage says each State faces distinct challenges and opportunities and must consider them. But it doesn't explicitly say the responsibility is only of each State. Also, the passage talks about collaboration and tailoring strategies, not just responsibility.</p>
                <p>(b) India is too diverse to implement any effective strategy or programme to address/tackle the climate change. This is a negative statement. The passage acknowledges diversity but suggests this diversity requires tailored strategies, not that effective strategies are impossible. So this option is not aligned with the passage's tone.</p>
                <p>(c) It is basically the responsibility of the Union Government to implement the climate action plans and ensure net zero emissions. The passage does not say responsibility lies solely with the Union Government. It focuses on States' unique challenges and opportunities. So this option is too narrow and ignores regional diversity.</p>

                <p>Given: A < B > C < D > E > F > G = H. We need to test if B is always greater than E. Let's simplify the relationships: B > C, D > C, D > E. There is no direct relationship between B and E. We cannot determine the exact numerical order between B and E without knowing actual values. For example: It's possible that B is 20, C is 15, D is 25, E is 22. Or B is 18, C is 10, D is 12, E is 11. Counter-example: Let A=10, B=20, C=15, D=25, E=22. Then B < E (20 < 22) is false. Let B=20, C=10, D=15, E=12. Then B > E is true. So Statement I is not always true.</p>
                <p>Given: P > Q = R > S = T ≤ U = V > W. We need to test if S is always less than V. Let's break it down: S = T and T ≤ V. This means S ≤ V. That's not guaranteed to be strictly less. S could be equal to V. So Statement II is also not always true.</p>

                <h4>21. Answer: <strong>A</strong></h4>
                <p>Benefit of economic reforms percolates down more slowly to agriculture than other sectors. This fits well. Agriculture growth stagnated after the 1980s, while non-agriculture growth rose consistently. So reforms and economic growth benefits reached agriculture later or more slowly. For India, the green revolution was not as useful as it was expected to be. The passage does not talk about green revolution directly. The 1980s saw the highest growth, which aligns with the green revolution's success period. So this statement doesn't fully capture the passage's main point. India lagged behind other countries in adapting mechanized and modernised farming. The passage doesn't compare India to other countries. So this is outside the passage scope. Rural to urban migration resulted in stagnant agriculture sector; this is outside the passage scope.</p>

                <h4>22. Answer: <strong>D</strong></h4>
                <p>Why Assumption I is invalid: The passage says nothing about corporate farming or large-scale commercial crops reducing the divergence. In fact, large-scale corporate farming might face many socio-economic and structural challenges in India (land fragmentation, small farmers). So, assuming that just "large-scale commercial/corporate farming" would fix the problem goes beyond the passage and is not necessarily true.</p>
                <p>Why Assumption II is invalid: The passage never talks about free insurance or heavy subsidies being the missing factor. Simply providing subsidies or free insurance may not guarantee sustained growth or reduce divergence. The problem is more structural and about how reforms impact agriculture, not only financial inputs. Also, heavy subsidies like in developed countries may not be feasible or effective in India's context.</p>

                <p>Assumption II: "Handloom products are no longer appealing and attractive in the rapidly changing modern world."

                <p>We want to find how many numbers from 1 to 100 are not divisible by any of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Divisors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9. Using Inclusion-Exclusion principle: Total numbers not divisible = 100 - (divisible by any). Multiples of 2: 50, 3: 33, 5: 20, 7: 14, 9: 11. Since any number divisible by 9 is also divisible by 3, we can simplify the problem to numbers not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7. This calculation is complex. A simpler check: Numbers not divisible are 1 and primes > 9. Primes: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97. Total 21 primes. Plus 1. That's 22. So, the correct answer is 22, which is not an option. Let's re-read the OCR. The OCR calculates Total Divisible = 78. So, Not Divisible = 100 - 78 = 22. The options are likely wrong, but the logic points to 22. If we follow the OCR, it states 22. The provided answer key says C (21), which is close. The logic is likely based on the calculation leading to 22.</p>

                <p>We want sets of 3 positive integers where LCM = 1001 and HCF = 1. First, factor 1001 = 7 × 11 × 13. The numbers in the set must be made from these primes. To have HCF=1, no single prime can be common to all three numbers. To have LCM=1001, all three primes must be present across the set. Examples of sets: {7, 11, 13}, {1, 77, 91}, {7, 1, 143}, {11, 1, 91}, {13, 1, 77}, {77, 13, 1}, {91, 7, 1}, {143, 7, 11}. There are more than 7 such sets.

                <h4>29. Answer: <strong>B</strong></h4>
                <p>PQR - PS = PPT. Given Q=3, this is (100P + 30 + R) - (10P + S) = 110P + T. Simplifying: 90P + 30 + R - S = 110P + T. This leads to R - S - T = 20P - 30. Given digits are distinct and non-zero, T < 6. By trying P=1, the equation becomes R - S - T = -10. By trying P=2, R - S - T = 10. Trying P=2 with T<6 and R,S distinct from {2,3} leads to multiple valid pairs for (R,S). For instance if T=1, R-S=11 (not possible with single digits). The OCR seems to have a calculation error. A correct derivation leads to R-S-T = 20P-30. If we try P=1, R-S-T = -10 or R+10=S+T. If T=4, R+10=S+4 -> S=R+6. Possible (R,S) pairs where digits are distinct from {1,3,4}: (2,8). If T=5, R+10=S+5 -> S=R+5. Possible (R,S) pairs where digits are distinct from {1,3,5}: (2,7), (4,9). Total 3 possible values of (R,S).</p>

                    <li>Only 16% of the calories fed to chickens are recovered by humans.</li>
                    <li>For large animals, this efficiency drops to just 5-7%.</li>
                    <li>Grains and legumes that could directly feed humans are being used to feed animals instead.</li>
                    <li>This leads to greater inequality in food utilization, especially as wealthier societies consume more animal products.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Yes - animal-based food is far less efficient because most of the energy from plant-based feed is lost in conversion. It takes more resources to produce the same number of calories via meat. Feeding grains directly to humans would feed more people than using them to raise animals.</p>

                <p>We want to find the highest power n such that 35ⁿ = (5 × 7)ⁿ divides the product. So, we count how many 5's and 7's are in the product.

                <ul>
                    <li>7 = 7¹ → one 7</li>
                    <li>343 = 7³ → three 7s</li>
                    <li>385 = 5 × 7 × 11 → one 5 and one 7</li>
                    <li>1000 = 10³ = (2 × 5)³ → three 5s</li>
                    <li>2401 = 7⁴ → four 7s</li>
                    <li>77777 = 7 × ... → one 7</li>

                <p>Total number of 5s = 1 (from 385) + 3 (from 1000) = 4. Total number of 7s = 1+3+1+4+1 = 10.
                Since 35ⁿ needs n 5s and n 7s, the maximum n is the smaller count → 4.</p>

                <p>P speed = 5 rounds/hour, Q speed = 3 rounds/hour. Since they move in opposite directions, their relative speed = 5+3 = 8 rounds per hour. They cross each other every 1/8 hour = 7.5 minutes. Total crossings from 5:00 to 7:00 (2 hours) = 8 × 2 = 16 crossings. We need to find crossings between 5:20 and 7:00. Crossings before 5:20: The first crossing is at 5:07:30, the second at 5:15:00. The third is at 5:22:30 (which is after 5:20). So, 2 full crossings happen before 5:20.

                <p>Let tram length be L and speed be v. Person N speed = 3 km/h = 0.833 m/s. Person Y speed = 4 km/h = 1.111 m/s. Overtaking formula: L = (relative speed) × time. For N: L = (v - 0.833) × 8. For Y: L = (v - 1.111) × 9. Equating them: 8v - 6.664 = 9v - 9.999. So, v = 3.335 m/s. Substitute v back into N's equation: L = (3.335 - 0.833) × 8 = 2.502 × 8 ≈ 20 meters.</p>

                <p>The number 1234567897654321 has 17 digits. If a number N has d digits, then N² will have either 2d-1 or 2d digits. Since N has 17 digits, we can check if N is a perfect square. The original number N would have d digits where 2d-1=17 or 2d=17. 2d=18 gives d=9. So if N has 9 digits, N² could have 17 digits. The number given is not a perfect square. The OCR seems to be about a different question. Re-reading the OCR, the question is just about the number of digits. The number 1234567897654321 clearly has 17 digits.</p>

                <p><strong>In a democracy, a strong opposition is required only if the Head of Government is indifferent.</strong> The passage doesn't say opposition is needed only when the leader is indifferent. It emphasizes opposition is always necessary. So, Assumption I is not valid.</p>

By trial and error, if P=3, Q=4: 3 × (30 + 4) = 3 × 34 = 102. This means 100R+S=102, so R=1, S=2. But for RRSS, R should be 1, S should be 2. So RRSS = 1122. Checking: 11P × (10P + Q) = 11*3 * (34) = 33 * 34 = 1122. This fits. So, Q=4.</p>

                <h4>80. Answer: <strong>C</strong></h4>
                <p>If two natural numbers differ by 10, say a and a+10, then the natural numbers divisible by 5 between them are all multiples of 5 between a and a+10. Since 10 is a multiple of 5, there will be exactly two numbers divisible by 5 in that range (including possibly the endpoints). So, the natural numbers divisible by 5 between two numbers differing by 10 are consecutive multiples of 5, spaced by 5 units.</p>
