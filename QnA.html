            // --- QUESTIONS 1-50 ---
            { question: `I've just finished my 10th standard. How do I choose between Science, Commerce, and Arts?`, answer: `This is a crucial first step in your career journey. Don't choose based on marks or peer pressure. Instead, use a three-pronged approach:<br><br><b>Interest:</b> What subjects do you genuinely enjoy studying? Do you like solving complex problems (Science), understanding systems and economies (Commerce), or exploring creativity and human behaviour (Arts)?<br><br><b>Aptitude:</b> What are you naturally good at? Are you strong in logic and math, or do you excel at communication and analysis? Take an aptitude test to get objective insights.<br><br><b>Career Goals:</b> What kind of work do you see yourself doing in the future? Research careers linked to each stream. Science opens doors to Engineering, Medicine, Research. Commerce leads to CA, Finance, Management. Arts leads to Civil Services, Design, Journalism, Law.` },
            { question: `Are Arts/Humanities a viable career option in India?`, answer: `Absolutely! The perception of Arts being a "weaker" stream is outdated. An Arts degree develops critical thinking, communication, and analytical skills, which are highly valued everywhere. Career options are vast: Civil Services (UPSC), Law (after an integrated BA LLB), Journalism, Psychology, Design, Content Creation, Marketing, Academics, and many more.` },
            { question: `What is the difference between PCM and PCB in Science? Which one should I choose?`, answer: `<b>PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Maths):</b> This is the "Engineering" stream. It's for careers in engineering, architecture, data science, computer applications, etc.<br><br><b>PCB (Physics, Chemistry, Biology):</b> This is the "Medical" stream. It's essential for careers like MBBS, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Biotechnology.<br><br><b>PCMB (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology):</b> This keeps both options open but is very demanding. The choice depends entirely on whether your interest lies in life sciences or applied mathematics and technology.` },
            { question: `My parents want me to be an engineer, but I am interested in design. What should I do?`, answer: `This requires a balanced approach:<br><br><b>Do Your Research:</b> Prepare a detailed presentation for your parents on the scope and success of design careers (UI/UX, Product Design, Animation).<br><br><b>Find a Middle Path:</b> Explore fields that combine technology and design, like Product Design or UI/UX Engineering.<br><br><b>Seek Counselling:</b> An expert's opinion can provide a neutral perspective.<br><br><b>Communicate Respectfully:</b> Explain your passion with a clear plan. Your conviction will be persuasive.` },
            { question: `What are some good "Plan B" options if I don't get into IIT or a top medical college?`, answer: `Not getting into your dream college isn't the end of the world.<br><br><b>For Engineering Aspirants:</b> Consider top NITs, IIITs, BITS, VIT, or a B.Sc in a related field followed by an M.Tech or MBA from a top institute.<br><br><b>For Medical Aspirants:</b> Besides MBBS, consider Dentistry (BDS), Veterinary Science (BVSc), Pharmacy (B.Pharm), Physiotherapy (BPT), or Biotechnology. These are all respected and well-paying professions.` },
            { question: `How many hours should I study daily to crack JEE Main/NEET?`, answer: `Quality over quantity is key. A good benchmark is 6-8 hours of focused self-study per day, besides coaching. Break it down into sessions of 1.5-2 hours with short breaks. Consistency is more important than cramming.` },
            { question: `Is it necessary to join a coaching institute for entrance exams like CAT or UPSC?`, answer: `It's not strictly necessary, but can be very helpful. Coaching provides structured guidance, experienced faculty, and a competitive peer group. However, self-study is possible if you are highly disciplined, using standard textbooks, online resources, and a rigorous mock test series. The choice depends on your learning style.` },
            { question: `I am an average student. Can I crack a tough exam like CLAT or AIIMS?`, answer: `Yes, you can. Entrance exams are less about being a "brilliant" student and more about strategy, hard work, and consistency. Many "average" students outperform "toppers" because they start early, are consistent, focus on strategy, and believe in themselves.` },
            { question: `How do I manage board exam preparation along with entrance exam studies?`, answer: `The key is integration. The syllabus for core science subjects is largely similar. When you study a chapter, prepare it for both exams. In the last 2-3 months before boards, shift your focus more towards the board exam pattern. A well-structured timetable is your best friend.` },
            { question: `What is the role of mock tests in preparation?`, answer: `Mock tests are the most critical part of your preparation. They help you:<ul><li>Simulate Exam Conditions to manage time and pressure.</li><li>Identify Weak Areas for revision.</li><li>Develop a Strategy for attempting the paper.</li><li>Track Progress. Aim for at least 15-20 full-length mocks.</li></ul>` },
            { question: `What is the difference between a B.Tech and a B.E. degree?`, answer: `Functionally and for employment purposes, there is no significant difference. The core curriculum and career opportunities are identical. The difference in name is mostly historical and depends on the university. Employers treat both degrees equally.` },
            { question: `Is a degree from an IIT/IIM/AIIMS/NLU a guarantee for a successful career?`, answer: `A degree from a premier institute gives you a phenomenal head start with a strong brand name, a powerful alumni network, and access to the best recruiters. However, it is not a "guarantee." Long-term success depends on your continuous learning, soft skills, and work ethic.` },
            { question: `How important is the college's NIRF ranking when choosing an institution?`, answer: `The NIRF ranking is a good starting point, but it shouldn't be the only factor. Also consider: the specific branch or department reputation, location for internship opportunities, and real student reviews about campus life and placement support.` },
            { question: `How can I build a strong profile during my college years?`, answer: `Grades are important, but not everything. Build a strong profile through:<ul><li><b>Internships:</b> Do at least 2-3 relevant internships.</li><li><b>Projects:</b> Work on personal or academic projects that showcase your skills.</li><li><b>Extracurriculars:</b> Participate in college clubs and take leadership roles.</li><li><b>Learn New Skills:</b> Take online courses to learn skills not covered in your syllabus.</li><li><b>Networking:</b> Connect with seniors, alumni, and professors.</li></ul>` },
            { question: `What is the difference between an MBA and a PGDM? Which is better?`, answer: `An MBA is a degree offered by universities, while a PGDM is a diploma offered by autonomous institutes (like IIMs). For all practical purposes, a PGDM from a top institute like an IIM is considered equivalent or even more valuable than an MBA from most universities. The reputation of the institute matters far more than the title.` },
            { question: `Is studying abroad better than studying in India?`, answer: `It's not about "better," it's about "different."<br><br><b>Study in India (Pros):</b> Top institutes (IITs/IIMs) are world-class, significantly lower cost, strong local network for jobs in India.<br><br><b>Study Abroad (Pros):</b> Global exposure, access to cutting-edge research, curriculum flexibility, and better opportunities for an international career. The choice depends on your career goals and financial situation.` },
            { question: `Which country is best for Indian students to study in?`, answer: `This depends on your course and budget. Popular destinations are:<ul><li><b>USA:</b> Best for STEM and MBA; expensive.</li><li><b>UK:</b> Shorter Master's programs; strong in finance and law.</li><li><b>Canada:</b> Welcoming immigration policies; strong in IT and business.</li><li><b>Australia:</b> Great for hospitality and IT.</li><li><b>Germany:</b> Top choice for engineering with low/zero tuition fees in public universities.</li></ul>` },
            { question: `How do I apply for scholarships to study abroad?`, answer: `Start early! The process is competitive. Look for scholarships on university websites, government portals (like Fulbright, Chevening), and private trusts. A strong application requires a high GPA, good standardized test scores (GRE/GMAT/IELTS), a compelling Statement of Purpose (SOP), and strong Letters of Recommendation (LORs).` },
            { question: `What are GRE, GMAT, IELTS, and TOEFL?`, answer: `These are standardized tests for admission to foreign universities.<ul><li><b>GRE:</b> For Master's/PhD programs, primarily in STEM and humanities.</li><li><b>GMAT:</b> For MBA and business school programs.</li><li><b>IELTS & TOEFL:</b> English proficiency tests required to prove you can handle a course taught in English.</li></ul>` },
            { question: `What is a Statement of Purpose (SOP)? How do I write a good one?`, answer: `The SOP is a personal essay, a crucial part of your application. It's your chance to tell the admissions committee who you are beyond your grades. A good SOP should cover your background, why you want to study that specific course at that particular university, and your career goals. Be authentic, tell a story, and proofread meticulously.` },
            { question: `What are the biggest government job exams in India after graduation?`, answer: `The most prestigious exams are:<ul><li><b>UPSC Civil Services Exam (CSE):</b> For IAS, IPS, IFS, etc.</li><li><b>SSC CGL:</b> For non-gazetted Group B and C posts.</li><li><b>IBPS PO / SBI PO:</b> For Probationary Officers in public sector banks.</li><li><b>RBI Grade B:</b> For manager-level posts in the Reserve Bank of India.</li><li><b>Defence Exams (CDS, AFCAT):</b> For officer roles in the Armed Forces.</li></ul>` },
            { question: `Can I prepare for UPSC while working a full-time job?`, answer: `Yes, it is challenging but definitely possible. The key is immaculate time management. Utilize weekends for core syllabus and squeeze in 2-3 hours of focused study on weekdays. Your work experience can be a huge asset in the interview stage.` },
            { question: `What is the difference between IAS and IPS?`, answer: `Both are recruited through the UPSC CSE.<br>• <b>IAS (Indian Administrative Service):</b> The premier administrative service responsible for policy formulation and implementation.<br>• <b>IPS (Indian Police Service):</b> Responsible for law and order, and internal security. IPS officers command the police forces.` },
            { question: `Are government jobs better than private sector jobs?`, answer: `It depends on your priorities.<br>• <b>Government Jobs (Pros):</b> Job security, social respect, work-life balance.<br>• <b>Private Sector Jobs (Pros):</b> Faster career growth, higher salaries, opportunities for innovation.<br>If stability and social impact are your priorities, a government job is a great choice. If you are driven by fast growth and innovation, the private sector might be a better fit.` },
            { question: `What is the eligibility criteria for most government jobs?`, answer: `General criteria include:<ul><li><b>Nationality:</b> Citizen of India.</li><li><b>Age Limit:</b> Usually between 21 to 30 years for the general category, with relaxations for reserved categories.</li><li><b>Educational Qualification:</b> A bachelor's degree in any discipline from a recognized university.</li></ul>` },
            { question: `What is Data Science and is it a good career option in India?`, answer: `Data Science uses scientific methods to extract knowledge from data. It is one of the hottest career options in India. Roles include Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer, and they command very high salaries. A strong background in Math, Statistics, and Programming is required.` },
            { question: `I want a career in Digital Marketing. Do I need a specific degree?`, answer: `No, you don't need a specific degree. What's more important are the skills: SEO, SEM, Social Media Marketing, Content Marketing, and Analytics. The best way to start is by taking up online certifications and working on internships or freelance projects to build a portfolio.` },
            { question: `What is UI/UX Design? How is it different from Graphic Design?`, answer: `• <b>Graphic Design:</b> Focuses on visual aesthetics like logos and layouts (how things look).<br>• <b>UI (User Interface) Design:</b> A subset of graphic design for digital products, focusing on the look and feel of screens and buttons.<br>• <b>UX (User Experience) Design:</b> Much broader, focusing on the entire user journey to ensure a product is easy and enjoyable to use (how things work).` },
            { question: `Is a career in Ethical Hacking/Cybersecurity good in India?`, answer: `It is an excellent and rapidly growing field. As more businesses move online, the need for cybersecurity professionals to protect data is skyrocketing. You need a strong foundation in computer networks. Certifications like CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) can significantly boost your career.` },
