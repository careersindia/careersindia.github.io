                <h2>Strategies for Solving Para Jumbles</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> Para Jumbles are a set of related sentences that have been mixed up. The goal is to rearrange them into their original, logical order to form a coherent paragraph.
                </div>
                <h3>Key Strategies</h3>
                <ul class="strategy-list">
                    <li><strong>1. Find the Opening Sentence:</strong> This sentence introduces the main topic, person, or concept. It's usually a general statement and will not start with pronouns like 'he', 'it', 'they', or transition words like 'but', 'so', 'therefore', 'also'.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Identify Mandatory Pairs:</strong> Look for sentences that have an unbreakable logical link.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pronoun-Antecedent Link:</strong> A sentence with a pronoun (e.g., `he`, `its`, `they`) must follow the sentence that introduces the noun it refers to. (e.g., A sentence about `Ashoka` must come before a sentence starting with `He...`).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cause and Effect Link:</strong> The sentence describing a cause will come before the sentence describing its effect.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronological Order:</strong> Arrange events based on the sequence of time (e.g., `first`, `then`, `finally`).</li>
                            <li><strong>Idea-Example Link:</strong> A sentence presenting a general idea will come before the sentence that gives a specific example of it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>3. Find the Concluding Sentence:</strong> This sentence summarizes the paragraph, provides a final thought, or states a conclusion. It often starts with words like `Thus`, `Therefore`, `Hence`, or `Finally`.</li>
                    <li><strong>4. Use the Options (if available):</strong> In multiple-choice questions, you can test the given sequences to see which one creates the most logical and coherent paragraph.</li>
                </ul>
