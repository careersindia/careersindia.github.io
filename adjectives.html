                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>An adjective is a **describing word**. Its main job is to modify (provide more information about) a noun or a pronoun. Adjectives answer questions like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What kind?</strong> (e.g., a <em>dangerous</em> batsman, a <em>red</em> car)</li>
                    <li><strong>How many?</strong> (e.g., <em>ten</em> candies, <em>several</em> people)</li>
                    <li><strong>Which one?</strong> (e.g., <em>that</em> car, the <em>last</em> page)</li>
                    <li><strong>How much?</strong> (e.g., <em>more</em> money, <em>little</em> time)</li>
                </ul>

                 <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>This</strong> pen writes very smoothly.</li>

                <h3>Interrogative Adjectives</h3>
                <p>These are used with nouns to ask questions. They are: <em>which, what, whose</em>. They must be followed by a noun.</p>
                 <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>Which</strong> book are you reading?</li>

                </ol>

                <h3>Indefinite Adjectives</h3>
                <p>These describe nouns in a non-specific way.</p>

                <h2>Degrees of Adjectives</h2>
                <p>Adjectives have three degrees of comparison to show the intensity of a quality.</p>
                
                <h3>Positive Degree</h3>
                <p>The base form of the adjective, which simply describes a quality.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">

                <h3>Comparative Degree</h3>
                <p>Compares the qualities of two nouns. Formed by adding '-er' or using 'more'.</p>

                <h3>Superlative Degree</h3>
                <p>Compares the qualities of more than two nouns. Formed by adding '-est' or using 'most'. The article 'the' is used before it.</p>

                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The <strong>brave</strong> firefighter rescued the cat. (What kind of firefighter?)</li>
                    <li>She gave me <strong>several</strong> reasons for her decision. (How many reasons?)</li>
                    <li>I would like to buy <strong>that</strong> computer. (Which one?)</li>
                    <li>It was a <strong>delicious</strong> meal. (What kind of meal?)</li>
                    <li>He is an <strong>intelligent</strong> and <strong>hardworking</strong> student. (What kind of student?)</li>
                    <li>There are <strong>five</strong> books on the table. (How many?)</li>
                    <li>The <strong>first</strong> person in line will get the ticket. (Which person?)</li>
                    <li>She has a <strong>positive</strong> outlook on life. (What kind of outlook?)</li>
                    <li>I have <strong>no</strong> money left. (How much money?)</li>
                    <li>This is <strong>my</strong> car. (Whose car?)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Attributive Position Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> The most common place to find an adjective is directly before the noun it describes. If a word fits between an article (a, the) and a noun, it's very likely an adjective.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He drives an <strong>expensive</strong> car.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>little</strong> puppy was sleeping.</li>
                    <li>She wore a <strong>beautiful</strong> dress.</li>
                    <li>They live in a <strong>large, modern</strong> apartment.</li>
                    <li>A <strong>sudden</strong> noise startled everyone.</li>
                    <li>He is a <strong>famous</strong> actor.</li>
                    <li>We saw a <strong>bright</strong> light.</li>
                    <li>She is an <strong>excellent</strong> student.</li>
                    <li>It was a <strong>dark</strong> and <strong>stormy</strong> night.</li>
                    <li>He bought a <strong>new</strong> phone.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3. Predicative Position Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> An adjective can appear after a linking verb (like *is, am, seem, become, feel, look, taste*) to describe the subject.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The view from the top is <strong>spectacular</strong>.</li>
                    <li>She seems very <strong>happy</strong> today.</li>
                    <li>The food tastes <strong>amazing</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The travelers were <strong>exhausted</strong>.</li>
                    <li>His story sounds <strong>unbelievable</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The children are <strong>hungry</strong>.</li>
                    <li>He became <strong>famous</strong> overnight.</li>
                    <li>The weather appears <strong>pleasant</strong>.</li>
                    <li>I feel <strong>confident</strong> about the exam.</li>
                    <li>The room was <strong>spacious</strong> and <strong>bright</strong>.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>4. Comparative & Superlative Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> If a word can be changed to compare things (by adding -er/-est or using more/most), it's an adjective.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>This car is <strong>fast</strong>, but that one is <strong>faster</strong>.</li>
                    <li>She is <strong>tall</strong>, but her brother is the <strong>tallest</strong> in the family.</li>
                    <li>This book is <strong>interesting</strong>, but that one is <strong>more interesting</strong>.</li>
                    <li>He is the <strong>most intelligent</strong> person I have ever met.</li>
                    <li>The weather is <strong>bad</strong> today, but it was even <strong>worse</strong> yesterday.</li>
                    <li>This problem is <strong>hard</strong>, but the next one is the <strong>hardest</strong>.</li>
                    <li>She is a <strong>good</strong> student, but he is <strong>better</strong>.</li>
                    <li>This is a <strong>beautiful</strong> painting, but that is the <strong>most beautiful</strong> one.</li>
                    <li>He is <strong>strong</strong>, and his brother is even <strong>stronger</strong>.</li>
                    <li>This is a <strong>small</strong> box, but I need the <strong>smallest</strong> one you have.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>5. Adverb Modification Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Adjectives can often be modified by adverbs that describe their intensity (like *very, extremely, quite, really, too*).</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>It was a <strong>very challenging</strong> exam.</li>
                    <li>The new employee is <strong>extremely efficient</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The room was <strong>quite spacious</strong>.</li>
                    <li>She was <strong>too tired</strong> to finish the work.</li>
                    <li>I am <strong>so happy</strong> to see you.</li>
                    <li>This is a <strong>really interesting</strong> book.</li>
                    <li>The test was <strong>surprisingly easy</strong>.</li>
                    <li>He is a <strong>rather unusual</strong> person.</li>
                    <li>The soup is <strong>almost cold</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The results were <strong>truly amazing</strong>.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>6. Suffix Test (Derivational Morphology)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Many adjectives are formed by adding a common suffix (ending) to another word. Look for endings like *-ful, -less, -ous, -ive, -able, -al, -ic, -y*.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He is a very <strong>creative</strong> person. (-ive)</li>
                    <li>The situation is becoming <strong>dangerous</strong>. (-ous)</li>
                    <li>Your help was <strong>valuable</strong>. (-able)</li>
                    <li>The <strong>national</strong> anthem was played at the ceremony. (-al)</li>
                    <li>It was a <strong>childish</strong> thing to do. (-ish)</li>
                    <li>She has a <strong>powerful</strong> voice. (-ful)</li>
                    <li>The night was dark and <strong>starless</strong>. (-less)</li>
                    <li>It was a <strong>heroic</strong> act. (-ic)</li>
                    <li>The path was very <strong>muddy</strong> after the rain. (-y)</li>
                    <li>This problem is not <strong>solvable</strong>. (-able)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>7. Opposites Test (Antonyms)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Most descriptive adjectives have an opposite (antonym). Sometimes this is a different word (hot/cold), and sometimes it's formed with a prefix (un-, in-, im-).</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The path was <strong>smooth</strong>, not <strong>rough</strong>.</li>
                    <li>He felt <strong>happy</strong>, not <strong>unhappy</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Her answer was <strong>correct</strong>, not <strong>incorrect</strong>.</li>
                    <li>It is <strong>possible</strong> to succeed, not <strong>impossible</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The manager is very <strong>polite</strong>, not <strong>impolite</strong>.</li>
                    <li>This is a <strong>legal</strong> document, not an <strong>illegal</strong> one.</li>
                    <li>The story was <strong>believable</strong>, not <strong>unbelievable</strong>.</li>
                    <li>He is a <strong>responsible</strong> person, not <strong>irresponsible</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The room was <strong>tidy</strong>, not <strong>untidy</strong>.</li>
                    <li>She is very <strong>patient</strong>, unlike her <strong>impatient</strong> brother.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>8. Noun-Adjective Distinction Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Adjectives describe nouns. Nouns are the names of things. For example, 'gold' is a noun (a material), but in 'a gold coin', 'gold' acts as an adjective describing the coin.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>She has a <strong>stone</strong> wall around her garden. ('stone' describes the wall)</li>
                    <li>He is a <strong>history</strong> teacher. ('history' describes the teacher)</li>
                    <li>I bought a <strong>leather</strong> jacket. ('leather' describes the jacket)</li>
                    <li>We attended a <strong>music</strong> festival. ('music' describes the festival)</li>
                    <li>This is a <strong>computer</strong> science class. ('computer' describes science)</li>
                    <li>She opened the <strong>car</strong> door. ('car' describes the door)</li>
                    <li>He is a <strong>business</strong> administration student. ('business' describes administration)</li>
                    <li>This is a <strong>winter</strong> coat. ('winter' describes the coat)</li>
                    <li>They sell <strong>kitchen</strong> appliances. ('kitchen' describes appliances)</li>
                    <li>It was a <strong>morning</strong> flight. ('morning' describes the flight)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>9. Syntactic Role Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> The main job of an adjective is to modify a noun or pronoun. Unlike nouns, adjectives cannot usually act as the subject or object of a sentence by themselves.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The <strong>energetic</strong> children played for hours. ('energetic' modifies 'children')</li>
                    <li>She has a <strong>positive</strong> outlook. ('positive' modifies 'outlook')</li>
                    <li>Someone <strong>new</strong> has joined the team. ('new' modifies the pronoun 'someone')</li>
                    <li>The cake was <strong>sweet</strong> and <strong>delicious</strong>. ('sweet' and 'delicious' modify 'cake')</li>
                    <li>His <strong>final</strong> decision was a surprise. ('final' modifies 'decision')</li>
                    <li>We need a <strong>different</strong> approach. ('different' modifies 'approach')</li>
                    <li>He showed <strong>great</strong> courage. ('great' modifies 'courage')</li>
                    <li>Something <strong>important</strong> happened. ('important' modifies 'something')</li>
                    <li>The <strong>old, dusty</strong> book was on the shelf. ('old' and 'dusty' modify 'book')</li>
                    <li>She gave a <strong>clear</strong> explanation. ('clear' modifies 'explanation')</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>10. Extra Technique: Wh-Questions</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> To find an adjective, first locate a noun. Then, ask questions about that noun like "What kind of...?", "Which...?", or "How many...?". The word that answers is the adjective.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>Sentence: He bought a <strong>red</strong> car. (What kind of car?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: The <strong>tall</strong> girl won. (Which girl?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: She baked a <strong>delicious, chocolate</strong> cake. (What kind of cake?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: There are <strong>five</strong> books on the table. (How many books?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: It was a <strong>long</strong> and <strong>difficult</strong> journey. (What kind of journey?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: He has <strong>two</strong> black dogs. (How many dogs? What kind of dogs?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: I want the <strong>last</strong> piece of cake. (Which piece?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: That is a <strong>huge</strong> building. (What kind of building?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: She gave a <strong>brilliant</strong> performance. (What kind of performance?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: He made <strong>several</strong> good points. (How many points? What kind of points?)</li>
                </ol>
