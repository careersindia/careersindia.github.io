                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Key Characteristics:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are always followed by the base form of the main verb (e.g., He <em>can run</em>, not He <em>can runs</em>).</li>
                        <li>They do not change their form (no -s, -ed, -ing endings).</li>
                        <li>They are used to form questions (e.g., <em>Can</em> you help?) and negatives (e.g., He <em>cannot</em> help).</li>
