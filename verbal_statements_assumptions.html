        <h2>Part 1: Statement and Assumption</h2>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="question-block">
            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> To clean clothes, one should use Surf Excel detergent.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> Surf Excel creates more foam.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> Surf Excel helps in removing oil and dirt.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Only Assumption 2 is implicit.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> The speaker explains that the primary purpose advertised for a detergent is its cleaning ability, not the amount of foam it produces. Therefore, a person hearing the statement would naturally assume it's effective at cleaning (removing dirt), which is Assumption 2. The amount of foam is a secondary characteristic and not a necessary assumption.</p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="question-block">
            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Everyone likes to study reasoning with Sahil Sir.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> Sahil Sir is the <em>only</em> reasoning teacher.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> Not a single person likes to study any other subject.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Neither Assumption 1 nor 2 is implicit.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> Assumption 1 uses the word "only" (एकमात्र), which is an absolute or "perfection" word. The statement implies popularity, not a monopoly. Assumption 2 makes a broad negative generalization about other subjects, which is entirely outside the scope of the original statement about reasoning.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="question-block">
            <h3>Question 3</h3>
            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Do not throw garbage on the road.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> It is possible to throw garbage on the road.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> Such a warning will have some effect.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Both Assumptions 1 and 2 are implicit.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> For Assumption 1, a warning is only issued for an action that is possible. The sign exists precisely because people can and do throw garbage on the road. For Assumption 2, the person who puts up the sign does so with the positive assumption that people will read it, understand it, and comply, thus having the desired effect of keeping the road clean.</p>

            <h3>Question 4</h3>
            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Reasoning has become easy for students because of Sahil Sir's class.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> Sahil Sir's classes are the <em>only</em> reasoning classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> Students do not enjoy reasoning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Neither Assumption 1 nor 2 is implicit.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> Assumption 1 again uses the invalid absolute word "only." Assumption 2 is a direct contradiction. If a subject has become "easy" for students, it's illogical to assume they don't enjoy it; in fact, the opposite is more likely.</p>

        <div class="question-block">
            <h3>Question 5</h3>
            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> To reach Neil Island quickly, take a boat instead of a bus.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> Due to being in a remote location, these islands cannot be reached easily.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> Boats are also available for trips to Neil Island.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Only Assumption 2 is implicit.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> The statement compares two modes of transport (boat and bus) in terms of speed. It makes no comment on the overall ease or difficulty of reaching the island, so Assumption 1 is invalid. For the advice "take a boat" to be logical, it must be assumed that boats are actually an available option, making Assumption 2 valid.</p>

            <h3>Question 6</h3>
            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> The sharp increase in pollution is now a global phenomenon.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> <em>All</em> countries have realized this and are working towards gaining control over it.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> Growing population, industries, highways, and construction are out of control.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Neither Assumption 1 nor 2 is implicit.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> Assumption 1 uses the word "All," an absolute that is very hard to justify. We cannot assume every single country is actively working on the problem. Assumption 2 lists potential causes of pollution, but the statement itself doesn't mention them or claim they are "out of control." This is external information not implied by the statement.</p>

            <h3>Question 7</h3>
            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> The proper age for a child to be admitted to school is 4 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> At this age, a child is familiar with adaptability (is receptive to learning and adapting).</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> After this age, children do not like to go to school.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Only Assumption 1 is implicit.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> The speaker identifies Assumption 1 as a universal fact and the core reason <em>why</em> age 4 is considered appropriate. Young children are highly adaptable and can easily start learning, which is a valid assumption behind the statement. Assumption 2 is an unsubstantiated generalization; a child's desire to go to school isn't strictly tied to being over or under the age of four.</p>

            <h3>Question 8</h3>
            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> The government has decided to pay a compensation of ₹1 Lakh to the families of those who died in train accidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> The government has sufficient funds to cover the expenses incurred due to compensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> This may reduce the incidents of train accidents in the near future.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Only Assumption 1 is implicit.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> When a government or official body makes a financial commitment, it is always assumed they have the funds to fulfill it. Assumption 1 is therefore valid. Assumption 2 is illogical; paying compensation after an accident is a reactive measure, not a preventative one. It does not address the root cause of accidents and therefore cannot be assumed to reduce their frequency.</p>

        <!-- Question 9 -->
        <div class="question-block">
            <h3>Question 9</h3>
            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Should a cricket team have more than one wicket-keeper in a match?</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 1 (Yes):</strong> Yes, if one of them gets injured, the other can take his place.</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 2 (No):</strong> No, they will fight with each other.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Only Argument 1 is strong.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> Argument 1 provides a practical and logical reason (injury backup) which is a common strategy in team sports. This is a strong argument. Argument 2 is a baseless and childish assumption that professionals will fight, which is not a logical reason and is therefore a weak argument.</p>

            <p><strong>1. QUESTION:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Should women be given 75% reservation in all officer-level recruitments in SSC?</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 1 (Yes):</strong> Yes, women are more capable than men.</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 2 (No):</strong> No, then who will take care of the household responsibilities?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Neither Argument 1 nor 2 is strong.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> Argument 1 is weak because it tries to justify a point by demeaning another group ("more capable than men") rather than on its own merits. Argument 2 is based on a stereotype that household responsibilities are solely a woman's job, which is a weak and biased argument.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Should factories running at a loss be closed down?</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 1 (No):</strong> No, this will increase the rate of unemployment as many people will lose their jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 2 (Yes):</strong> Yes, in a competitive world, the rule is "survival of the fittest."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Only Argument 1 is strong.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> Argument 1 is strong because it points to a significant and direct socio-economic consequence (unemployment) of the proposed action. Argument 2 is a weak, generic proverb and doesn't address the specific consequences of closing factories. The goal should be to fix the problem, not just eliminate the entity.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Should the Railways immediately stop issuing free passes to all its employees?</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 1 (No):</strong> No, the employees have a <em>right</em> to travel for free.</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 2 (Yes):</strong> Yes, this will help the Railways provide better facilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Neither Argument 1 nor 2 is strong.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> Argument 1 is weak because the free pass is a perk or an allowance, not a constitutional or fundamental "right." Argument 2 is weak because it makes a vague claim without evidence. There is no direct link to prove that stopping free passes would automatically lead to better facilities; the savings could be used elsewhere.</p>

                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Should all banks whose NPA (Non-Performing Assets) exceeds their profit be closed down?</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 1 (No):</strong> No, this will have a negative impact on the Indian economy.</li>

            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Only Argument 1 is strong.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> Argument 1 is strong because closing multiple banks would undeniably cause a major disruption in the economy, affecting employees, customers, and market stability. Argument 2 is weak because it uses the absolute word "only." Closing a bank is an extreme step; there could be other solutions like mergers, restructuring, or government intervention.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Statement:</strong> Should there be a complete ban on the sale of liquor near highways?</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 1 (No):</strong> No, people should have the freedom to make decisions as it is their fundamental right.</li>
                <li><strong>Argument 2 (Yes):</strong> Yes, 90% of road accidents involve drivers who are under the influence of alcohol.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2. ANSWER:</strong> Only Argument 2 is strong.</p>
            <p><strong>3. EXPLANATION:</strong> Argument 1 is weak because a fundamental right does not extend to actions that endanger the lives of others. Drunk driving is a public safety issue, not just a personal choice. Argument 2 is strong because it provides a data-backed (90%) and logical reason that directly connects liquor sales on highways to a major negative consequence (accidents), making a compelling case for the ban on public safety grounds.</p>
