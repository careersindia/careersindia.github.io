                    <strong>Concept:</strong> Parallelism is the principle that words, phrases, and clauses in a list or comparison must have the same grammatical form or structure.

                 <h3>Where and How It Is Used</h3>
                <p>Ensure that items joined by coordinating conjunctions (`and`, `but`, `or`), correlative conjunctions (`either...or`, `not only...but also`), or in comparisons are grammatically balanced.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>**Basic Rule:** A positive statement takes a negative tag, and a negative statement takes a positive tag.</li>

                <h2>5. Inversion</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> Inversion is the reversal of the normal subject-verb word order. Instead of `Subject + Verb`, the order becomes `Verb + Subject`.
                </div>
                 <h3>Where and How It Is Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**In Questions:** The helping verb comes before the subject. (e.g., `Are you coming?`)</li>
                    <li>**After Negative/Limiting Adverbs:** When a sentence begins with a negative adverbial (like `No sooner`, `Hardly`, `Scarcely`, `Never`, `Not only`), the helping verb and subject must be inverted for formal emphasis.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>20 Examples:</h3>
                <ul class="example-list">

                     <li><span class="incorrect">Standard:</span> He can swim. <span class="correct">Inverted (Question):</span> <span class="feature">Can he</span> swim?
                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation (Question):</strong> The modal verb `Can` is inverted with the subject `he`.</div>

                        <div class="explanation"><strong>Explanation (Negative Adverbial):</strong> The negative adverb `Hardly` at the beginning forces the inversion of the helping verb `had` and the subject `I`.</div>

                     <li><span class="correct">Inverted:</span> <span class="feature">Never have I</span> seen such a beautiful sight.
