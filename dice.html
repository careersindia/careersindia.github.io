            <h3>Key Rules for Solving Dice Problems</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rule 1 (One Common Face):</strong> When two positions of a die show only one common face, the other faces are opposite to each other in a clockwise direction starting from the common face. The remaining unseen number is opposite the common number.</li>
                <li><strong>Rule 2 (Two Common Faces):</strong> When two positions of a die show two common faces, the third, non-common faces are always opposite each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Rule 3 (No Common Face):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Standard Dice:</strong> If the sum of any two adjacent faces is NOT 7, it is a standard die. The sum of opposite faces is always 7 (1 is opposite 6, 2 is opposite 5, 3 is opposite 4).</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-Standard Dice:</strong> If the sum of any two adjacent faces IS 7, it is a non-standard die. In this case, the top face is opposite the top face, the front is opposite the front, and the side is opposite the side of the other position.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Example Questions</h2>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two positions of a die are shown: (6, 4, 1) and (5, 2, 3). Find the number opposite to 4.</p>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 2</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> There are no common faces. We check if it's a standard die. In the first position, 6 + 1 = 7. Since adjacent faces sum to 7, it is a non-standard die. We apply the rule for non-standard dice: the corresponding faces are opposite. The front face (4) is opposite the other front face (2).</p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two positions of a die are shown: (1, 6, 3) and (4, 5, 2). Find the number opposite to 2.</p>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 6</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> There are no common faces. In the first position, 1 + 6 = 7, and in the second, 5 + 2 = 7. This confirms it is a non-standard die. Applying the rule, corresponding faces are opposite: Top (1) is opposite Top (4), Side (3) is opposite Side (5), and Front (6) is opposite Front (2).</p>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 3</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two positions of a die are shown: (2, 6, 4) and (1, 5, 3). Find the number opposite to 6.</p>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 1</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> There are no common faces. We check the sums of adjacent faces: 2+6=8, 6+4=10, 2+4=6. None sum to 7, so this is a standard die. In a standard die, opposite faces must sum to 7. Therefore, the number opposite to 6 is 1 (since 6 + 1 = 7).</p>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 4</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two positions of a die are shown: (3, 5, 1) and (3, 4, 2). Find the number opposite to 3.</p>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 6</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The number 3 is the only common face. We use the clockwise rule. Starting from 3 in the first die, we go clockwise: 3 → 5 → 1. In the second die: 3 → 4 → 2. This means 5 is opposite 4, and 1 is opposite 2. The only remaining number, 6, must be opposite the common face, 3.</p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 5</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two positions of a die are shown: (1, 2, 3) and (1, 5, 4). Find the number opposite to 1.</p>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 6</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The number 1 is the only common face. Applying the clockwise rule: from the first die, we have 1 → 2 → 3. From the second die, we have 1 → 5 → 4. Therefore, 2 is opposite 5, and 3 is opposite 4. The remaining number, 6, is opposite the common face, 1.</p>

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 6</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two positions of a die are shown: (6, 3, 2) and (6, 5, 4). Find the number opposite to 6.</p>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 1</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The number 6 is the only common face. Following the clockwise rule: 6 → 3 → 2 and 6 → 5 → 4. This tells us that 3 is opposite 5, and 2 is opposite 4. The unseen number, 1, must be opposite the common face, 6.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Question 7 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 7</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two positions of a die are shown: (6, 1, 4) and (1, 5, 6). Find the number opposite to 4.</p>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> 5</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The numbers 1 and 6 are common to both positions. According to Rule 2, when two faces are common, the remaining non-common faces are opposite each other. Here, the remaining faces are 4 and 5, so 4 is opposite 5.</p>
        </div>
        
        <hr>

        <!-- Question 8 -->
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Question 8</h3>
            <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Two positions of a die are shown with letters: (A, B, C) and (C, D, B). Find the face opposite to C.</p>
            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Cannot be determined.</p>
            <p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong> The letters B and C are common to both positions. Using Rule 2, we can determine that the non-common faces, A and D, are opposite each other. However, this method does not provide information about the faces opposite to the common letters (B and C). The opposite of C could be either of the two unseen letters (e.g., E or F).</p>
