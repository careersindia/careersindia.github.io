                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Concept:</strong> An idiom is a phrase or expression whose meaning cannot be understood from the ordinary, literal meaning of its individual words. The meaning is figurative and culturally specific.
                </div>
                <h3>Why are they important for competitive exams?</h3>
                <p>Idioms are a pure test of vocabulary and cultural context. Examiners use them to check a candidate's familiarity with the nuances of the English language. They frequently appear in Reading Comprehension, Sentence Completion, and direct "Meaning of the Idiom" questions.</p>
                <ul class="example-list">
                    <li>The idiom <span class="feature">"kick the bucket"</span> has nothing to do with kicking or buckets; it means "to die".</li>
                    <li>The idiom <span class="feature">"a piece of cake"</span> does not refer to food; it means "something very easy".</li>

                <h2>How to Learn Idioms Effectively</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    Memorizing idioms requires active learning strategies, not just passive reading.
                </div>
                <h3>Key Strategies</h3>
                <ul class="strategy-list">
                    <li><strong>1. Learn in Context:</strong> Don't just memorize the idiom and its meaning. Always read the example sentence to understand how it is used. Context helps with retention.</li>
                    <li><strong>2. Group Thematically:</strong> Learn idioms in categories, as arranged in this guide (e.g., all idioms related to 'Body Parts', all idioms related to 'Animals'). This creates mental associations and makes them easier to remember.</li>
                    <li><strong>3. Visualize the Literal Meaning:</strong> Try to create a mental image of the literal words (e.g., a cat actually getting someone's tongue). This funny or strange image can help you remember the figurative meaning.</li>
                    <li><strong>4. Use Them in Sentences:</strong> The best way to remember an idiom is to use it. Try to make your own sentences with the new idioms you learn.</li>
                    <li><strong>5. Focus on High-Frequency Idioms:</strong> The lists in this guide are curated from common exam questions. Focus on mastering these first.</li>
