            <h2>1. Theory: About Order & Ranking</h2>
            <p><strong>Order & Ranking</strong> is a type of logical reasoning problem that deals with the position or rank of a person or object in a sequence, row, or queue. Questions can be based on rank from left/right or top/bottom, or on comparative attributes like height, weight, or marks.</p>
            <p>This topic is essential for competitive exams in India as it tests a candidate's ability to visualize arrangements and apply formulas to solve problems quickly and accurately.</p>

            <h3>Key Formulas & Techniques</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Finding Total Number of Persons:</strong><br>
                When the rank of one person is given from both ends (Left and Right).
                <div class="diagram-formula">Total (T) = Rank from Left (L) + Rank from Right (R) - 1</div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Finding Rank from One End:</strong><br>
                When the Total and rank from one end are given.
                <div class="diagram-formula">Rank from Other End = Total (T) - Given Rank + 1</div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Finding Number of Persons Between Two People:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Case 1: No Overlapping (T > L + R)</strong>
                        <div class="diagram-formula">Between = T - (L + R)</div></li>
                        <li><strong>Case 2: Overlapping (L + R > T)</strong>
                        <div class="diagram-formula">Between = (L + R) - T - 2</div></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Interchanging Positions:</strong><br>
                If two people interchange positions, and one person's new position is given.
                <div class="diagram-formula">Total = (Person A's Old Position) + (Person B's Old Position) - 1</div>No, that's not right. The best formula is:
                 <div class="diagram-formula">Total = (A's Old Position from Left) + (A's New Position from Right) - 1</div> Also not right. The simplest:
                <div class="diagram-formula">Total = (A's new position from one end) + (B's old position from other end) - 1</div>
                <br>Number of people between them:
                <div class="diagram-formula">Between = (Difference in position of a person) - 1</div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Comparison-Based Ranking:</strong> For questions like "A is taller than B but shorter than C", the best technique is to use inequality symbols (<code>></code>, <code><</code>) to create a final, ordered sequence.</li>

                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 10:</strong> A bus starts with some passengers. At the first stop, half of the passengers get down and 10 get in. At the second stop, one-fifth of the passengers get down and 3 get in. The bus now has 15 passengers. How many passengers were there at the beginning?</p><p>A) 20 <br> B) 25 <br> C) 30 <br> D) 35</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) 30</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p><strong>Technique:</strong> Work backwards from the end.
<br>1. <strong>Before second stop:</strong> The bus had 15 passengers after 3 got in. So before that, there were <code>15 - 3 = 12</code> passengers. These 12 passengers represent the four-fifths (1 - 1/5) that remained. So, before anyone got down, there were <code>12 * (5/4) = 15</code> passengers.
<br>2. <strong>Before first stop:</strong> The bus had 15 passengers after 10 got in. So before that, there were <code>15 - 10 = 5</code> passengers. These 5 passengers represent the half that remained. So, before anyone got down, there were <code>5 * 2 = 10</code>. Wait, my calculation is wrong.
Let's restart working forward. Let start passengers = x.
1. After 1st stop: (x/2) + 10.
2. At 2nd stop, 1/5 get down. Remaining = (4/5) * [(x/2)+10].
3. Then 3 get in. Total = (4/5) * [(x/2)+10] + 3 = 15.
4. (4/5) * [(x/2)+10] = 12.
5. (x/2)+10 = 12 * (5/4) = 15.
6. x/2 = 5 => x = 10. This is also not in options.
Let's try the options. A) 20. Start=20. Stop 1: 10 get down, 10 get in -> 20. Stop 2: 1/5 (4) get down, 3 get in -> 16+3=19. No.
B) 25. No, not divisible by 2.
C) 30. Start=30. Stop 1: 15 get down, 10 get in -> 25. Stop 2: 1/5 (5) get down, 3 get in -> 20+3=23. No.
There is a flaw in my interpretation or the question. Let me re-read "one-fifth of the passengers get down". It means 1/5 of the passengers *at that point*.
Let's try C) 30 again.
Start = 30.
After 1st stop: Half get down (15 left), 10 get in. Bus now has 15+10 = 25 passengers.
At 2nd stop: 1/5 of 25 get down (5 get down). 20 are left. 3 get in. Bus now has 20+3=23. Still doesn't match 15.
Let's work backwards again. Final = 15. Before 3 got in = 12. These 12 are 4/5 of the total. So total before getting down was 12 * (5/4) = 15.
This 15 was the number after 10 got in at the first stop. So before that, there were 15-10=5. These 5 were half the original. So original was 5*2=10.
The question is flawed. I will fix the numbers. "The bus now has 23 passengers".
<br><br><strong>Revised Question 10:</strong> (Numbers adjusted for a clean solution) ... The bus now has 23 passengers. How many passengers were there at the beginning?
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> C) 30</p>
<h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. Let the initial number of passengers be <code>x</code>.
<br>2. At the first stop, half get down, so <code>x/2</code> remain. 10 get in. Passengers = <code>(x/2) + 10</code>.
<br>3. At the second stop, 1/5 get down. Remaining passengers = <code>(4/5) * [(x/2) + 10]</code>. 3 get in.
<br>4. Final count: <code>(4/5) * [(x/2) + 10] + 3 = 23</code>.
<br>5. Solving the equation: <code>(4/5) * [(x/2) + 10] = 20</code> -> <code>(x/2) + 10 = 25</code> -> <code>x/2 = 15</code> -> <code>x = 30</code>.
<br>So, there were <strong>30</strong> passengers at the beginning.</p></div></details></li>

Right End</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. Komal's new position is 10th from left. This is after shifting 4 places left. So, her original position was 10 + 4 = 14th from left.
<br>2. Swati is 3 places to the right of Komal's original position. So, Swati's position is 14 + 3 = 17th from the left.

Let's re-read. "P is taller than ONLY U". This means P is second shortest, and U is shortest.
But "Q is the shortest of all". Contradiction.
Let's assume "P is taller than U".
T > S > R. P > U. Q is shortest.
So order is: ?, ?, T, S, R, P, U, Q. This doesn't make sense with 6 friends.
Let's go back to "P is taller than only U".
_ > _ > _ > P > U.
And "S is shorter than T but taller than R". T > S > R.
And "Q is the shortest of all".
The statement "P is taller than only U" means there are only two people, P and U. This contradicts the premise of 6 friends.
Let's fix the question. Let's remove Q.
"P is taller than only U" -> _ > _ > P > U.
"S is shorter than T but taller than R" -> T > S > R.
The 6 friends are P, Q, R, S, T, U. Let's assume P is taller than U.
T>S>R, P>U. Q is shortest. The tallest are T, S, P. We cannot determine the third tallest.
The question is flawed.
<br><br><strong>Revised Question 15:</strong> Among six friends P,Q,R,S,T,U, S is shorter than T but taller than R. P is shorter than only T. Q is shorter than R but taller than U. Who is the third shortest?
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> R</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. T > S > R.
2. P is shorter than only T -> T > P > (everyone else).
3. R > Q > U.
Combining: T > P > S > R > Q > U.
The third shortest is R.</p></div></details></li>

                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 21 (Tougher):</strong> In a class, B is 5 ranks ahead of A. The total number of students is 40. If A's rank from the bottom is 18th, what is B's rank from the top?</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> 18th</p><h4>Diagram</h4><div class="diagram-text">Bottom <--17--> (A, 18th) <--4--> (B, 23rd) ... Top
Total = 40
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. A is 18th from the bottom.
2. B is 5 ranks ahead of A. "Ahead" usually means a better rank. If rank is from the top, B's rank is lower number. If from bottom, B's rank is higher number. Let's assume "ahead" means better rank (closer to top).
So B is 5 ranks higher than A from the bottom. B's rank from bottom = 18 + 5 = 23rd.
3. B's rank from top = Total - B's from bottom + 1 = 40 - 23 + 1 = 18th.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 25 (Tougher):</strong> In a row of boys, A is 15th from the left and B is 4th from the right. There are 3 boys between A and B. C is just to the left of A. What is C's position from the right?</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> 9th</p><h4>Diagram</h4><div class="diagram-text">(C, 14th) (A, 15th) <--3--> (B, 4th from R) <--3--> R
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. This must be an overlapping case, otherwise the total would be too large.
2. C is just to the left of A, so C is 14th from the left.
3. Let's find the total. A is 15th L, B is 4th R. 3 between them.
This means B's position from left is 15 - 3 - 1 = 11th.
4. Total = B's L + B's R - 1 = 11 + 4 - 1 = 14.
5. C is 14th from left, in a row of 14 people. This means C is at the far left end. His position from right is 14th.
Wait, let's re-read. A is 15th from L. B is 4th from R. 3 between. C is left of A.
Let's try non-overlapping. Total = 15 + 4 + 3 = 22.
C's position from left is 14th.
C's position from right = Total - C's from left + 1 = 22 - 14 + 1 = 9th. This is more plausible.</p></div></details></li>

Combined: D > A > B > (C, E in some order)
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. "A is shorter than only D" means D is the tallest and A is the second tallest: D > A > _, _, _.
2. "B is taller than C and E". B > C and B > E.
3. "B is not the shortest".
4. Combining these, the only possible order is D > A > B > C/E > E/C.
5. The third tallest person is B.</p></div></details></li>
                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 41 (Toughest):</strong> In a row of 44 students, E is 16th from the right. M is 7th to the left of E. V is 18th to the right of M. What is V's rank from the left end?</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> 39th</p><h4>Diagram</h4><div class="diagram-text">L ... M <--6--> E <--15--> R (E is 16th from R)
M is 16+7=23rd from R.
V is 18 places to the right of M. So V is 23-18=5th from R.
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. Total = 44. E is 16th from Right.
2. M is 7th to the left of E. So M's rank from Right is 16 + 7 = 23rd.
3. V is 18th to the right of M. So V's rank from Right is 23 - 18 = 5th.
4. V's rank from Left = Total - V's from Right + 1 = 44 - 5 + 1 = 40th.
Wait, 44-5+1 = 40.
Let me re-check my logic. E is 16th R. M is 23rd R. V is 18th to the right of M.
R <---(V, 5th)---(E, 16th)---(M, 23rd)---...
Yes, V is 5th from the right.
V's rank from left = 44-5+1 = 40th.
The given answer is 39th. Let me re-calculate. 44-5+1=40. The answer key seems off. I will adjust the answer.
<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 40th</p>

If there are 4 children between D and F, what is the minimum possible number of children in the row?</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> 15</p><h4>Diagram (Overlapping Case for Minimum)</h4><div class="diagram-text">L <--6--> (F) <--4--> (D) <--13--> R
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>For the minimum number of children, we must assume an overlapping case.
<br>In this case, F is to the left of D.
<br>D is 14th from the left. F is 7th from the right. There are 4 children between them.
<br>Let's find F's position from the left. F's position = D's position - number between - 1 = 14 - 4 - 1 = 9th from the left.
<br>Now we have F's rank from both sides: 9th from left and 7th from right.
<br>Total (minimum) = F's Left + F's Right - 1 = 9 + 7 - 1 = 15.
<br>The minimum possible number of children is 15.</p></div></details></li>
