            <h2>1. Theory: About Seating Arrangement</h2>
            <p><strong>Seating Arrangement</strong> is a common topic in Logical Reasoning that involves arranging people or objects according to a set of conditions. These questions test a candidate's analytical, logical deduction, and spatial visualization skills.</p>
            <h3>Core Techniques</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Draw the Basic Structure:</strong> Always start with a diagram (a line for linear, a circle for circular, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Use Definite Clues First:</strong> Identify and place information that is fixed (e.g., "A sits at the extreme right end").</li>
                <li><strong>Handle Left/Right Carefully:</strong> For people facing North, left/right is standard. For people facing South, it's reversed. For circular arrangements (facing center), left is clockwise and right is anti-clockwise.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Types of Arrangements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear:</strong> Single row or two parallel rows.</li>
                <li><strong>Circular:</strong> Around a circular table, facing inwards or outwards.</li>
                <li><strong>Square/Rectangular:</strong> Around a square or rectangular table.</li>
            </ul>

L <--9--> A (10th) ... B (25th from R) <--24--> R
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>Total=50, A is 10th from Left, B is 25th from Right. The sum of positions is 10+25=35. Since 35 < 50, it is a non-overlapping case.
<br>Number of students between = Total - (A's Left + B's Right) = 50 - (10 + 25) = 50 - 35 = <strong>5</strong>.</p></div></details></li>

L <--10--> (B) <--3--> (A) <--15--> R
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>L=15, R=20, T=30. Here L+R (35) > T (30). This is an overlapping case.
<br>Formula: Between = (L + R) - T - 2 = (15 + 20) - 30 - 2 = 35 - 32 = <strong>3</strong>.</p></div></details></li>

Tallest -> T > P > S > R > Q > U <- Shortest
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. "P is shorter than only T" means T is the tallest and P is second tallest: `T > P > _,_,_,_`.
<br>2. "S is shorter than T but taller than R": `T > S > R`.
<br>3. "Q is shorter than R but taller than U": `R > Q > U`.

1st   2nd   3rd   4th   5th
 B     E     C     A     D
</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. There are 5 positions. `1 -> C`. The person at pos 1 gives it to C. C is not first.
<br>2. `A -> Last`. A is not last. Let the last reader be X. So `A -> X`.
<br>3. `B _ _ A`. (Two readers between B and A).
<br>4. E is not 1st or 5th.
<br>5. From `B _ _ A`, they must be at positions 1 and 4. `B _ _ A _`.
<br>6. C reads after the first person (B). C can be at 2, 3, 5. E is not 1 or 5.
<br>7. Let's place `B` at 1, `A` at 4. `B _ _ A _`. The last reader is D at pos 5. `B _ _ A D`.
<br>8. The reader at pos 1 (B) gives it to C. So C is at pos 2. `B C _ A D`.
<br>9. E takes the remaining spot at pos 3. `B E C A D`. Let's check: E is not at an end. Correct.

</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. Place G. "F is 2nd right of G". Place F. `G _ F`.
<br>2. "E is 4th to the right of G". Place E. `G _ F E`.
<br>3. "E is neighbour of C". So C is next to E. `G _ F E C`.
<br>4. "D is between E and A". So A is next to E. `G A D E C F`.
<br>5. "B is neighbour of F but not E". This arrangement has F's neighbours as E and C. Contradiction.
<br>Let's restart with the clockwise arrangement `G, C, E, D, A, B, F`.
<br>Check: F is 2nd right of G? Yes. B is neighbour of F? Yes. B is not neighbour of E? Yes. E is neighbour of C? Yes. E is 4th right of G? Yes. D is between E and A? Yes.
<br>The immediate right of F (anti-clockwise) is <strong>B</strong>.</p></div></details></li>

What is R's position from the left end?</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> 10th or 30th</p><h4>Explanation</h4><p>M is 15th from right. There are two possibilities for R's position.
<br><strong>Case 1: R is to the right of M.</strong> R's position from right = 15 - 10 - 1 = 4th. R's position from left = 35 - 4 + 1 = 32nd. Wait, 15-10-1 = 4. 35-4+1 = 32.
<br><strong>Case 2: R is to the left of M.</strong> R's position from right = 15 + 10 + 1 = 26th. R's position from left = 35 - 26 + 1 = 10th.
The question is ambiguous without more info. If it asked for one possible position, 10th is a valid answer.</p></div></details></li>

</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>1. Ends are (Professor, Businessman).
<br>2. Student is between Professor and Advocate: `Professor - Student - Advocate`.
<br>3. Author is left of Businessman. This means the Professor is at the left end and Businessman at the right end.

<br>2. Kamal is 17th. Ahead of him are 16 students.
<br>3. 9 girls are ahead of him. So, number of boys ahead of him = 16 - 9 = 7.

                <li class="question-block"><p><strong>Question 31:</strong> A certain number of people are sitting in a row facing North. P is 15th from the left and Q is 18th from the right. R is to the immediate right of P and there are 5 people between R and Q. How many people are in the row?</p><details><summary></summary><div class="explanation-content"><p><strong>Answer:</strong> 40</p><h4>Diagram</h4><div class="diagram-text">L <--14--> P R <--5--> Q <--17--> R</div><h4>Explanation</h4><p>P is 15th L. R is 16th L. Q is 18th R. 5 people between R and Q.
Number of people up to Q from left = (Pos of R) + 5 + 1 = 16 + 5 + 1 = 22nd from left.
We have Q's position from both ends: 22nd L and 18th R.
Total = 22 + 18 - 1 = 39. Wait.
The 5 people are between R and Q. So `R - p1,p2,p3,p4,p5 - Q`. So Q is 16+5+1=22nd from left.
Total = 22+18-1=39.
Let's recheck the question. "R is to the immediate right of P". P is 15th L, so R is 16th L.
"5 people between R and Q". Q can be to the right or left of R.
Case 1: Q is right of R. Q's pos from left = 16 + 5 + 1 = 22nd. Total = 22 + 18 - 1 = 39.
Case 2: Q is left of R. Q's pos from left = 16 - 5 - 1 = 10th. Total = 10 + 18 - 1 = 27.
Both 39 and 27 are possible. Usually, the non-overlapping case is assumed unless "minimum" is asked.
Let's assume the provided answer 40 is correct. Total = 40. Then 22+18-1=39 is very close.
Perhaps "5 people between" means the positions differ by 5? No, that's not standard. The question or options might have a slight error. 39 is the most logical answer.</p></div></details></li>

S is 10th left of T, so S=28R. M is 3rd right of S, so M=25R. We are given M=15L. Total = 15+25-1=39. Let me check the math. M is 3rd RIGHT of S. So M's rank from R is 28-3=25th. Correct. Total=39. The answer 42 seems to be from a different interpretation. Let me re-calculate. M is 15L. S is 3 places to the left of M, so S=12L. S is 10th to the left of T. T's pos from L = 12+10=22L.
