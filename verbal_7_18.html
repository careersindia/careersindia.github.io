    <h1>BLOOD RELATIONS</h1>
    <div class="section theory">
        <div class="section-title">Theory: Introduction</div>
        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Blood relations means the connection between two people by blood or basically by birth. In addition to this, two people or two families can be related by marriage, hence the relations which are created by marriage are also considered as blood relations.</p>
        <p>Blood relations can be best understood with the help of a family tree. A Family Tree is a pictorial or visual representation of our lineage. It can be considered to be like a tree where we can imagine our ancestors to be the roots, their children to be the trunk, grandchildren as branches, great grandchildren as leaves and so on.</p>
        <p>A family tree, not only gives us a better understanding of our lineage but it also helps us to understand our relationship with different people who have common ancestors.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Explanation: Solution to Example 1</div>
        <p>In this question we first make a family tree based on the given relations. Here the male members are represented by a box and the female members are represented by a circle. 'M' stands for man, 'B' stands for his brother, ‘F' stands for his father and 'GF' stands for grandfather.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"The only son of my grandfather" refers to the woman's father.</li>
            <li>"His brother's father" refers to the man's own father.</li>
            <li>So, the statement becomes: "The man's father is the woman's father."</li>
            <li>If they have the same father, the man and the woman are siblings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Studying the family tree, we understand that the man's grandfather is also the woman's grandfather. Hence, the woman is the man's sister.</p>

        <p>Here, Anita is represented by A and her mother by AM. Similarly, Prateek is represented by 'P' and his mother by 'PM'. Rohan is represented by 'R' and his mother by 'RM' respectively.</p>
        <p>On studying the family tree thus made, we find that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Rohan's mother (RM) is Anita's grandmother" means RM is the mother of Anita's mother (AM).</li>
            <li>"Rohan is Anita's mother's brother" confirms that RM is the mother of siblings R and AM.</li>
            <li>"Anita's mother is Prateek's aunt" means AM and Prateek's mother (PM) are sisters.</li>
