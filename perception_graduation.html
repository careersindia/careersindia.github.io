    { id: "grad-mcom-accounting", name: "M.Com - Accounting", score: 6, explanation: "Average perception. A solid, stable specialization for those aiming for roles in academia or as senior accountants. However, it's often perceived as less dynamic and lucrative than a professional certification like CA." },
