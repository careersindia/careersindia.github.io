                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Introducing a man to her husband, a woman named Priya said, “His brother’s father is the only son of my grandfather.” How is Priya related to the man?</p>
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Sister</p>
                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This is solved by breaking down Priya's statement from her perspective:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"my grandfather"</strong>: This refers to Priya's own grandfather.</li>
                    <li><strong>"the only son of my grandfather"</strong>: The only son of Priya's grandfather must be Priya's father.</li>
                    <li><strong>"His brother’s father"</strong>: This is the man's father.</li>
                    <li>By equating the statements, we understand that the man's father is the same person as Priya's father. If they share the same father, Priya and the man are siblings. Therefore, Priya is his sister.</li>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> For these "pointing" or "introducing" problems, the key is to always start the analysis from the phrase containing "my" or "your." Work backward from that anchor point, resolving each relationship step by step from the speaker's perspective. This method untangles the puzzle logically and avoids confusion.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Pointing to a man in a photograph, a boy named Leo said, “His mother’s only daughter is my mother.” How is Leo related to the man in the photograph?</p>
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Nephew</p>
                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We solve this by deconstructing Leo's statement:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>"His mother's only daughter"</strong>: "His" refers to the man in the photograph. The only daughter of his mother is his sister.</li>
                    <li><strong>"is my mother"</strong>: Leo is stating that the man's sister is his (Leo's) mother.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, Leo is the son of the man's sister. The son of one's sister is their nephew.</li>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The phrase "only daughter" is a critical piece of information that establishes a definite relationship (sister). Identifying these definitive clues is crucial. The logic flows from the man in the photo to his sister, and then from his sister to her son, Leo.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>There are six members in a family. Alex is the father of David. Ethan is the grandfather of David. Bella is the daughter-in-law of Clara. Frank is the uncle of David. What is the relationship of Clara with Frank?</p>
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Data inadequate</p>
                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>When we attempt to draw a family tree, we get two disconnected groups:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Group 1:</strong> Ethan is the grandfather of David, and Alex is the father of David. This means Ethan is Alex's father. Frank is David's uncle, so Frank is Alex's brother. This forms one complete family branch: (Ethan → [Alex, Frank] → David).</li>
                    <li><strong>Group 2:</strong> Bella is the daughter-in-law of Clara. This means Clara has a son, who is married to Bella. This forms a separate family unit.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since Clara (from Group 2) and Frank (from Group 1) are in completely separate family trees based on the given information, it is impossible to determine their relationship.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The goal in puzzle questions is to create a single, unified family tree. If the provided clues result in two or more separate, unlinked family groups, you cannot determine relationships between individuals from different groups. In such cases, the answer is "Data inadequate."</p>

                <p>Study the following codes: <br>
                A $ B means A is the father of B <br>
                A @ B means B is the mother of A <br>
                A * B means A is the wife of B <br>
                A # B means B is the daughter of A <br>
                Given the expression `A * B $ C # D @ E`, how is ‘B’ related to ‘D’?</p>
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Grandfather</p>
                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We build the family tree by decoding the expression step-by-step:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>A * B:</strong> A is the wife of B. (A is female, B is male).</li>
                    <li><strong>B $ C:</strong> B is the father of C. (C is B's child).</li>
                    <li><strong>C # D:</strong> D is the daughter of C. (C is D's parent, and D is female).</li>
                    <li><strong>D @ E:</strong> E is the mother of D. (This means C and E are a married couple, where C is the father and E is the mother of D).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the tree, B is the father of C, and C is the father of D. Therefore, B is the paternal grandfather of D.</p>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> In coded relations, it is critical to pay attention to the direction of the relationship. For example, `A @ B` means `B is the mother of A`, not the other way around. Carefully translating each symbol into a generation and gender relationship is the key to building an accurate family tree and avoiding errors.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Question</strong></p>
                <p>Nitin starts traveling towards the South and covers a distance of 5 km. He then turns left and travels 8 km. Finally, he takes another left turn and travels 5 km. How far is he from the starting point?</p>
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>8 km</p>
                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>Let's trace Nitin's path:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Starts at point A and moves 5 km South to point B.</li>
                    <li>From South, a left turn is towards the East. He moves 8 km East to point C.</li>
                    <li>From East, a left turn is towards the North. He moves 5 km North to point D.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>His 5 km Southward journey (A to B) is cancelled out by his 5 km Northward journey (C to D). This means his final point D is horizontally aligned with his starting point A. The only distance separating them is the 8 km he traveled East. Therefore, he is 8 km from his starting point.</p>

                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> The most effective way to solve such problems is to track the net displacement on the North-South and East-West axes. Here, the net North-South movement is `(-5 km) + (+5 km) = 0 km`. The net East-West movement is `+8 km`. The final distance is the result of these net movements.</p>

                <p>I am facing North. I turn 100° in the clockwise direction and then 145° in the anti-clockwise direction. Which direction am I facing now?</p>
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>North-West</p>
                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>We can calculate the net rotation:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Clockwise is positive (+100°), and anti-clockwise is negative (-145°).</li>
                    <li>Net rotation = `+100° - 145° = -45°`.</li>
                    <li>A negative rotation means an anti-clockwise turn from the starting direction.</li>
                    <li>Starting from North, a 45° anti-clockwise turn leads to the North-West direction.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>4. Important Notes</strong></p>
                <div class="notes">
                    <p><strong>Logic Technique:</strong> When multiple turns are involved, calculating the net rotation is far more efficient than plotting each turn individually. Treat one direction (e.g., clockwise) as positive and the other as negative, then find the sum to get the final effective turn.</p>

                <p>Arun walked 20 m towards South. Then, he turned to his left and walked 25 m. He then turned to his left and walked 20 m. He again turned to his right and walked 15 m. At what distance is he from the starting point and in which direction?</p>
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>40 m, East</p>
                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>Let's trace Arun's path from a starting point (A):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Walks 20 m South from A to B.</li>
                    <li>Turns left (East) and walks 25 m from B to C.</li>
                    <li>Turns left (North) and walks 20 m from C to D. At this point, D is 25 m East of the start (A).</li>
                    <li>Turns right (East) and walks another 15 m from D to E.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>His total distance from the starting point is the total eastward displacement: `25 m + 15 m = 40 m`. His final direction from the starting point is East.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>This is a mixed pattern based on letter positions. Analyzing `GLAMOUR` → `IJCNMWP` reveals the pattern: `+2, -2, +2, +1, -2, +2, -2`. Applying this same complex pattern to the word `TOPICAL` gives the result `VMRJACJ`.</p>

                <p>‘Sue Re Nik’ means ‘She is Brave’; ‘Pi Sor Re Nik’ means ‘She is always smiling’; ‘Sor Re Zhi’ means ‘Is always cheerful’. What is the code for ‘smiling’?</p>
                <p><strong>2. Answer</strong></p>
                <p>Pi</p>
                <p><strong>3. Explanation</strong></p>
                <p>By comparing the sentences, we find common words and their codes. Comparing 1 and 2, 'She is' = 'Re Nik'. Comparing 2 and 3, 'is always' = 'Sor Re'. From this, we deduce 'is' = 'Re'. This allows us to find that 'smiling' is the only word left in sentence 2, and 'Pi' is the only code left.</p>

                <p>The clue "D is second to the left of F" in a three-person row fixes their positions as `D, _, F`. "B is the neighbor of F" places B in the middle, making one row `D, B, F`.
