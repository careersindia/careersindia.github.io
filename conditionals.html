                <h2>What are Conditional Sentences?</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    <strong>Definition and Concept:</strong> Conditional sentences, also known as 'if' clauses, are sentences that express a condition and its result. They are used to talk about situations that are real, possible, or imaginary. Every conditional sentence has two parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>'if' clause:</strong> This part states the condition.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>main clause:</strong> This part states the result or consequence of the condition.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                 <h3>Where and How They Are Used</h3>
                <p>Conditionals are essential for expressing logic, cause and effect, and hypothetical scenarios. They are used everywhere, from scientific facts to expressing regrets about the past.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="zero" class="content-section">
                <h2>Zero Conditional</h2>
                <div class="rule">
                    <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Used for scientific facts, general truths, habits, and situations that are always true. If the condition is met, the result always happens.</p>
                    <p><strong>Syntax:</strong> If / When + Simple Present, ... Simple Present</p>
                    <p><strong>How to Identify:</strong> Look for the `Simple Present` tense in both the 'if' clause and the main clause. 'When' can often replace 'if' without changing the meaning.</p>
