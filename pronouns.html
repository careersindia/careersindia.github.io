                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>A pronoun is a word used **instead of a noun** to avoid repetition and make sentences easier to read. Words like *he, she, it, they, I, we,* and *you* are all pronouns.</p>
                
                <h3>Advantage of Using Pronouns</h3>
                <p><strong>Without Pronouns:</strong> <em>Michael</em> is 10 years old. <em>Michael</em> lives in Mumbai. <em>Michael</em> has one sister. <em>Michael</em> loves <em>Michael's</em> sister very much.</p>
                <p><strong>With Pronouns:</strong> <em>Michael</em> is 10 years old. <strong>He</strong> lives in Mumbai. <strong>He</strong> has one sister. <strong>He</strong> loves <strong>his</strong> sister very much.</p>

            <section id="types" class="content-section">
                <h2>Types of Pronouns</h2>
                
                <h3>Personal Pronouns (Subject & Object)</h3>
                <p>These refer to specific people or things. They change form depending on whether they are the subject (performing the action) or the object (receiving the action).</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>I</strong> (Subject) gave the book to <strong>him</strong> (Object).</li>
                    <li><strong>She</strong> (Subject) is waiting for <strong>us</strong> (Object).</li>
                    <li><strong>They</strong> (Subject) saw <strong>me</strong> (Object) at the library.</li>
                    <li><strong>He</strong> (Subject) told <strong>them</strong> (Object) a secret.</li>
                    <li><strong>We</strong> (Subject) invited <strong>her</strong> (Object) to the party.</li>
                    <li>Did <strong>you</strong> (Subject) see the message I sent <strong>you</strong> (Object)?</li>
                    <li>The dog loves <strong>its</strong> (Possessive Adjective) owner; the owner loves <strong>it</strong> (Object).</li>
                    <li>The teacher praised <strong>him</strong> (Object).</li>
                    <li><strong>She</strong> (Subject) is my best friend.</li>
                    <li>Please tell <strong>me</strong> (Object) the truth.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Reflexive Pronouns</h3>
                <p>These end in '-self' or '-selves' and are used when the subject and object of a sentence are the same. They reflect the action back to the subject.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He accidentally cut <strong>himself</strong> while cooking.</li>
                    <li>She taught <strong>herself</strong> how to play the guitar.</li>
                    <li>The cat is cleaning <strong>itself</strong>.</li>
                    <li>We must remind <strong>ourselves</strong> to stay positive.</li>
                    <li>You should be proud of <strong>yourself</strong>.</li>
                    <li>They found <strong>themselves</strong> in a difficult situation.</li>
                    <li>I promised <strong>myself</strong> I would study harder.</li>
                    <li>Be careful not to burn <strong>yourselves</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The computer restarted <strong>itself</strong>.</li>
                    <li>He reminded <strong>himself</strong> of the deadline.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Emphatic (Intensive) Pronouns</h3>
                <p>These have the same form as reflexive pronouns but are used to add emphasis to a noun or another pronoun. They are not essential to the sentence's meaning.</p>
                 <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>I <strong>myself</strong> will fix the computer.</li>
                    <li>The president <strong>himself</strong> attended the ceremony.</li>
                    <li>She baked the cake <strong>herself</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The students organized the event <strong>themselves</strong>.</li>
                    <li>He <strong>himself</strong> is responsible for this mistake.</li>
                    <li>The queen <strong>herself</strong> opened the new hospital.</li>
                    <li>We will complete the project <strong>ourselves</strong>.</li>
                    <li>You <strong>yourself</strong> must make the decision.</li>
                    <li>The city <strong>itself</strong> is beautiful, but the suburbs are not.</li>
                    <li>They admitted <strong>themselves</strong> that they were wrong.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Relative Pronouns</h3>
                <p>These introduce a dependent clause and connect it to an independent clause. They are: *who, whom, whose, which, that*.</p>
                 <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>This is the man <strong>who</strong> helped me find my wallet.</li>
                    <li>The book <strong>that</strong> you lent me was very interesting.</li>

                    <li>The manager, <strong>whom</strong> everyone respects, is retiring.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Interrogative Pronouns</h3>
                <p>These are used to ask questions. They are: *who, whom, whose, which, what*.</p>
                 <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>Who</strong> is at the door?</li>
                    <li><strong>What</strong> do you want for dinner?</li>
                    <li><strong>Which</strong> of these books is yours?</li>

                    <li><strong>Which</strong> do you prefer, tea or coffee?</li>
                    <li>To <strong>whom</strong> should I address this letter?</li>
                    <li><strong>What</strong> happened after I left?</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Indefinite Pronouns</h3>
                <p>These refer to non-specific people or things.</p>
                 <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>Someone</strong> left their keys on the table.</li>
                    <li><strong>Everyone</strong> enjoyed the concert.</li>

                    <li><strong>Both</strong> of the answers are correct.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Demonstrative Pronouns</h3>
                <p>These point out specific people or things. They are: *this, that, these, those*.</p>
                 <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>This</strong> is my favorite song.</li>
                    <li><strong>That</strong> looks like a difficult problem.</li>

                </ol>
                
                <h3>Possessive Pronouns</h3>
                <p>These show ownership and replace a noun. They are: *mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs*.</p>
                 <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The blue car is <strong>mine</strong>.</li>

                <h2>How to Identify Pronouns: 10 Techniques</h2>

                <h3>1. Meaning-Based Technique (Substitution Test)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A pronoun is a "stand-in" word that replaces a noun to avoid repetition. If a word is used instead of a person's or thing's name, it's a pronoun.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">

                </ol>

                <h3>2. Reference Test (Antecedent Link)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A pronoun usually refers back to a noun mentioned earlier (the "antecedent"). Look for a word that points back to another word.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The **doctor** (Antecedent) told the patient that **he** needed rest.</li>
                    <li>When the **students** finished the test, **they** were relieved.</li>
                    <li>The **book** was very long, but **it** was interesting.</li>
                    <li>My **sister, Sarah,** called to say **she** would be late.</li>
                    <li>The **cats** are sleeping; **they** look very peaceful.</li>

                    <li>**John** said **he** would be here soon.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>3. Types Test (Recognizing Categories)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> If you can recognize a word as belonging to one of the pronoun categories (Personal, Possessive, Indefinite, etc.), you know it's a pronoun.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>She** gave the book to **me**. (Personal Pronouns)</li>
                    <li>The blue coat is **mine**, not **yours**. (Possessive Pronouns)</li>
                    <li><strong>Someone** left an umbrella behind. (Indefinite Pronoun)</li>
                    <li><strong>Everything** is ready for the party. (Indefinite Pronoun)</li>
                    <li>**We** told **them** the news. (Personal Pronouns)</li>
                    <li>This is the man **who** helped me. (Relative Pronoun)</li>
                    <li>I hurt **myself**. (Reflexive Pronoun)</li>
                    <li><strong>What** is your name? (Interrogative Pronoun)</li>
                    <li><strong>That** is my house. (Demonstrative Pronoun)</li>
                    <li><strong>Nobody** came to the meeting. (Indefinite Pronoun)</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>4. Case Test (Subject vs. Object Form)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Personal pronouns change their form depending on their job in the sentence. If a word changes from 'I' to 'me', or 'he' to 'him', it's a pronoun.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>I** like coffee. vs. He gave the coffee to <strong>me</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>He** is my friend. vs. I saw <strong>him</strong> yesterday.</li>
                    <li><strong>She** is a doctor. vs. The award was given to <strong>her</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>We** won the game. vs. The coach praised <strong>us</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>They** are leaving. vs. I will call <strong>them</strong> later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Who** is coming? vs. To <strong>whom</strong> did you speak?</li>
                    <li>(Subject form is used before the verb; object form is used after the verb or a preposition).</li>
                    <li><strong>I** know the answer. vs. She told <strong>me</strong> the answer.</li>
                    <li><strong>They** are my neighbors. vs. I live next to <strong>them</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>He** called me. vs. I called <strong>him</strong>.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>5. Agreement Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A pronoun must agree in number (singular/plural) and gender with the noun it replaces.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The **boy** (singular, male) lost **his** hat.</li>
                    <li>The **girl** (singular, female) said **she** was tired.</li>
                    <li>The **students** (plural) submitted **their** essays.</li>
                    <li>The **cat** (singular, neuter) is cleaning **its** paws.</li>

                    <li>The **company** (singular) announced **its** profits.</li>
                    <li>The **lioness** (singular, female) protected **her** cubs.</li>
                    <li>My **parents** (plural) are on **their** way.</li>
                    <li>One **person** (singular) forgot **his** ticket.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>6. Independent Usage Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Pronouns can stand alone as a subject or object without a noun next to them. Adjectives, by contrast, usually need a noun.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>She** is the manager. (Stands alone as subject)</li>
                    <li>The prize was given to **him**. (Stands alone as object)</li>
                    <li><strong>Everyone** clapped. (Stands alone as subject)</li>
                    <li>Can **you** help? (Stands alone as subject)</li>
                    <li>Of all the options, I choose **this**. (Stands alone as object)</li>
                    <li><strong>Somebody** needs to clean this mess.</li>
                    <li><strong>They** are arriving soon.</li>
                    <li>The teacher praised **her**.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nobody** knows the answer.</li>
                    <li>Is this **yours**? (Possessive pronoun stands alone)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>7. Interrogative / Relative Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Words like *who, whom, whose, which,* and *that* are pronouns when they ask a question or link a descriptive clause to a noun.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>**Who** is at the door? (Interrogative)</li>
                    <li>**Which** do you prefer? (Interrogative)</li>
                    <li>The man **who** lives next door is a pilot. (Relative)</li>
                    <li>This is the book **that** I was telling you about. (Relative)</li>
                    <li>I don't know **what** happened. (Pronoun as object)</li>
                    <li>To **whom** did you give the file? (Interrogative)</li>
                    <li>This is the car **which** won the race. (Relative)</li>
                    <li>She is the person **whose** opinion I trust. (Relative)</li>
                    <li>**What** is the time? (Interrogative)</li>
                    <li>The company **that** he works for is very large. (Relative)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>8. Reflexive / Emphatic Test (-self/-selves)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Pronouns that end in *-self* or *-selves* are easy to spot. They are reflexive or emphatic pronouns.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>The cat is washing <strong>itself</strong>. (Reflexive)</li>
                    <li>He accidentally cut <strong>himself</strong>. (Reflexive)</li>
                    <li>I will fix the computer <strong>myself</strong>. (Emphatic)</li>
                    <li>The students organized the event <strong>themselves</strong>. (Emphatic)</li>
                    <li>You should be proud of <strong>yourself</strong>. (Reflexive)</li>
                    <li>She <strong>herself</strong> admitted the mistake. (Emphatic)</li>
                    <li>We must protect <strong>ourselves</strong> from harm. (Reflexive)</li>
                    <li>They built the house <strong>themselves</strong>. (Emphatic)</li>
                    <li>The machine turns <strong>itself</strong> off. (Reflexive)</li>
                    <li>He <strong>himself</strong> answered the phone. (Emphatic)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>9. Demonstrative Pointing Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> The words *this, that, these,* and *those* are pronouns when they "point to" and replace a noun, standing alone.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>This** is my favorite song. (Replaces 'this song')</li>
                    <li>I don't like these cookies, but I will take **those**. (Replaces 'those cookies')</li>
                    <li><strong>That** is a beautiful painting. (Replaces 'that painting')</li>
                    <li>Among the choices, **these** are the best. (Replaces 'these choices')</li>
                    <li>What was **that**? (Replaces 'that noise')</li>
                    <li><strong>This** tastes delicious.</li>
                    <li><strong>These** are my friends from college.</li>
                    <li><strong>That** is not what I meant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Those** are the mountains I was talking about.</li>
                    <li>Can you see **this**?</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>10. Extra Technique: The "Who?" or "What?" Question Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> This works just like the test for nouns. To find a subject or object pronoun, ask **"Who?"** or **"What?"** in relation to the verb. The answer will be the pronoun.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>Sentence: **She** read the book. (Who read the book?)</li>

                    <li>Sentence: **I** saw the movie. (Who saw the movie?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: **Everyone** was happy. (Who was happy?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: The dog chased **it**. (The dog chased what?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: The letter was for **her**. (The letter was for whom?)</li>
                </ol>
