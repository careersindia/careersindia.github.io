                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>A conjunction is a **joining word**. Its primary job is to connect words, phrases, and clauses to build longer, more complex sentences. Conjunctions help text to flow smoothly instead of sounding like a list of bullet points.</p>
                <p><strong>Example of flow:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Without Conjunction:</strong> Jai saw a dog on the road. He decided to adopt the dog. Jai brought the dog home.</li>
                    <li><strong>With Conjunctions:</strong> Jai saw a dog on the road <strong>and</strong> decided to adopt the dog, <strong>so</strong> he brought the dog home.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Dependent Clause (DC):</strong> Does not express a complete thought. It needs an independent clause to make sense.</li>
                </ul>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>I went to the market. (IC)</li>

            <section id="types" class="content-section">
                <h2>Types of Conjunctions</h2>
                
                <h3>Coordinating Conjunctions</h3>
                <p>These join two elements of equal grammatical rank (word + word, phrase + phrase, independent clause + independent clause). Remember the acronym **FANBOYS**: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He bought a book <strong>and</strong> a pen. (Joins two words)</li>
                    <li>You can wait at my home <strong>or</strong> at my office. (Joins two phrases)</li>
                    <li>I waited for him, <strong>but</strong> he didn’t come. (Joins two clauses)</li>
                    <li>She was tired, <strong>so</strong> she went to sleep.</li>
                    <li>He doesn't like tea, <strong>nor</strong> does he like coffee.</li>
                    <li>The weather was cold, <strong>yet</strong> it was a beautiful day.</li>
                    <li>I must go now, <strong>for</strong> I have an early appointment.</li>
                    <li>They can play outside, <strong>or</strong> they can watch a movie.</li>
                    <li>He is rich, <strong>but</strong> he is not happy.</li>
                    <li>She studied hard, <strong>so</strong> she passed the test.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Correlative Conjunctions</h3>
                <p>These work in pairs to join grammatically equal elements in a sentence.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>Neither</strong> Alex <strong>nor</strong> Robin can play baseball.</li>
                    <li>I want <strong>both</strong> the ice cream <strong>and</strong> the chocolate.</li>
                    <li>He ate <strong>not only</strong> the ice cream <strong>but also</strong> the chocolate.</li>
                    <li>You must <strong>either</strong> finish your work <strong>or</strong> stay home.</li>
                    <li><strong>Whether</strong> you like it <strong>or</strong> not, you have to do it.</li>
                    <li>She is <strong>as</strong> intelligent <strong>as</strong> her brother.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hardly</strong> had I left the house <strong>when</strong> it started to rain.</li>
                    <li>He is <strong>not only</strong> a good singer <strong>but also</strong> an excellent actor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Both</strong> my parents <strong>and</strong> my sister are coming.</li>
                    <li>You can have <strong>neither</strong> the cake <strong>nor</strong> the cookies.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Subordinating Conjunctions</h3>
                <p>These join an independent clause with a dependent clause, showing a relationship like cause, time, or condition.</p>
                 <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>Before</strong> we left home, I had had my breakfast.</li>
                    <li>We can start the class <strong>provided</strong> they come on time.</li>
                    <li><strong>When</strong> he was washing my car, I went to the store.</li>
                    <li><strong>Even though</strong> the weather was horrible, they still went outside.</li>
                    <li>He could not attend the meeting <strong>because</strong> he was sick.</li>
                    <li>I will not go <strong>unless</strong> you come with me.</li>
                    <li>She listened to music <strong>while</strong> she was studying.</li>
                    <li>He will pass the exam <strong>if</strong> he works hard.</li>
                    <li>I have been much happier <strong>since</strong> I moved to the new city.</li>
                    <li>Stay here <strong>until</strong> I get back.</li>

                <h2>How to Identify Conjunctions: 9 Techniques</h2>

                <h3>1. Meaning-Based Technique (Joining Test)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A conjunction is a "joining word" or a "connector." Its main job is to link words, phrases, or clauses together to create a smooth, logical sentence.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>I would like pizza <strong>and</strong> pasta. (Joins two words)</li>
                    <li>You can wait in the car <strong>or</strong> by the entrance. (Joins two phrases)</li>
                    <li>She studied hard, <strong>so</strong> she passed the exam. (Joins two clauses)</li>
                    <li>He is slow <strong>but</strong> steady. (Joins two words)</li>
                    <li>I will call you <strong>after</strong> I finish my work. (Joins two clauses)</li>
                    <li>He is tall <strong>and</strong> handsome.</li>
                    <li>The cat is sleeping on the sofa <strong>or</strong> under the bed.</li>
                    <li>I wanted to leave, <strong>but</strong> my friend wanted to stay.</li>
                    <li>She will be late <strong>because</strong> her car broke down.</li>
                    <li>He is wealthy, <strong>yet</strong> he is unhappy.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>2. Types Test (Coordinating, Subordinating, Correlative)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Identifying a conjunction is easy if you know its category: Coordinating (FANBOYS), Subordinating (shows relationship), or Correlative (works in pairs).</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>I was tired, <strong>but</strong> I finished the project. (Coordinating)</li>
                    <li>He didn't come <strong>because</strong> he was sick. (Subordinating)</li>
                    <li>You can have <strong>either</strong> the tea <strong>or</strong> the coffee. (Correlative)</li>
                    <li><strong>Although</strong> it was raining, they went for a walk. (Subordinating)</li>
                    <li>She is <strong>not only</strong> intelligent <strong>but also</strong> kind. (Correlative)</li>
                    <li>We can go to the movies, <strong>or</strong> we can stay home. (Coordinating)</li>
                    <li>I will wait here <strong>until</strong> you return. (Subordinating)</li>
                    <li><strong>Both</strong> the book <strong>and</strong> the movie were good. (Correlative)</li>
                    <li>He worked hard, <strong>so</strong> he was promoted. (Coordinating)</li>
                    <li>He will succeed <strong>if</strong> he perseveres. (Subordinating)</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>3. Position Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Conjunctions usually appear **between** the elements they connect. Subordinating conjunctions can start a sentence but will still be attached to one of the clauses.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>Do you want to go now <strong>or</strong> later?</li>
                    <li>He works hard <strong>and</strong> plays hard.</li>
                    <li>I trust him, <strong>for</strong> he has never lied.</li>
                    <li><strong>If</strong> you study, you will get good grades.</li>
                    <li>The movie was good, <strong>although</strong> it was a bit long.</li>
                    <li>She is smart, <strong>but</strong> she is lazy.</li>
                    <li>I will stay here <strong>while</strong> you go to the store.</li>
                    <li>He must be tired, <strong>so</strong> he is resting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Because</strong> it was cold, I wore a jacket.</li>
                    <li>He is strong, <strong>yet</strong> he is gentle.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>4. Deletion Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> If you remove the conjunction, the sentence often breaks into two separate, choppy sentences or becomes grammatically incomplete.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>I wanted to go, <strong>but</strong> I was too busy. → (Without: I wanted to go. I was too busy.)</li>
                    <li>She left <strong>while</strong> I was sleeping. → (Without: She left. I was sleeping.)</li>
                    <li>You will succeed <strong>if</strong> you work hard. → (Without: You will succeed. You work hard.)</li>
                    <li>He brought a jacket <strong>and</strong> an umbrella. → (Without: He brought a jacket. An umbrella.)</li>
                    <li>She cried <strong>because</strong> she was sad. → (Without: She cried. She was sad.)</li>
                    <li>I will wait, <strong>but</strong> I won't stay long.</li>
                    <li>They can go to the beach <strong>or</strong> the mountains.</li>
                    <li>He was tired, <strong>so</strong> he took a nap.</li>
                    <li><strong>Although</strong> he is rich, he is not arrogant.</li>
                    <li>She is honest, <strong>and</strong> she is kind.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>5. Non-Inflection Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Conjunctions are fixed words; they do not change their form. You cannot add endings like *-s, -ed,* or *-ing* to them.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>He reads <strong>and</strong> writes every day. ('and' never changes)</li>
                    <li>She will leave <strong>unless</strong> you ask her to stay. ('unless' never changes)</li>
                    <li>I will wait <strong>until</strong> you are ready. ('until' never changes)</li>
                    <li>This is a good plan, <strong>yet</strong> it has risks. ('yet' never changes)</li>
                    <li>I am staying home <strong>because</strong> I am not well. ('because' never changes)</li>
                    <li>She likes dogs, <strong>but</strong> he prefers cats.</li>
                    <li>I will go, <strong>if</strong> you go with me.</li>
                    <li>He is not here, <strong>so</strong> we will start without him.</li>
                    <li>We can leave now <strong>or</strong> later.</li>
                    <li>I studied hard, <strong>for</strong> the exam was important.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>6. Pairing Test (Correlative Conjunctions)</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Correlative conjunctions always come in fixed pairs. If you see the first word of a pair (like *either*), you can expect the second one (*or*) to appear later.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li><strong>Both</strong> the book <strong>and</strong> the movie were excellent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neither</strong> my brother <strong>nor</strong> my sister can come.</li>
                    <li>She was unsure <strong>whether</strong> to stay <strong>or</strong> to leave.</li>
                    <li>He is <strong>not only</strong> a great student <strong>but also</strong> a talented musician.</li>
                    <li>You must <strong>either</strong> finish your homework <strong>or</strong> stay inside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Just as</strong> you love music, <strong>so</strong> I love art.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hardly</strong> had she arrived <strong>when</strong> the phone rang.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not only</strong> did he apologize, <strong>but he also</strong> offered to pay.</li>
                    <li><strong>Both</strong> the teacher <strong>and</strong> the students were happy.</li>
                    <li>She likes <strong>neither</strong> the red dress <strong>nor</strong> the blue one.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>7. Distinction from Prepositions</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Some words (like *after, before, until*) can be prepositions or conjunctions. It's a **conjunction** if it's followed by a clause (with a subject and verb). It's a **preposition** if it's followed by just a noun or pronoun.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>Conjunction: Call me <strong>after</strong> you finish your work. (Clause: 'you finish')</li>
                    <li>Preposition: Let's meet <strong>after</strong> the meeting. (Noun: 'the meeting')</li>
                    <li>Conjunction: Brush your teeth <strong>before</strong> you go to bed. (Clause: 'you go')</li>
                    <li>Preposition: He arrived <strong>before</strong> me. (Pronoun: 'me')</li>
                    <li>Conjunction: We waited <strong>until</strong> the rain stopped. (Clause: 'the rain stopped')</li>
                    <li>Preposition: We waited <strong>until</strong> noon. (Noun: 'noon')</li>
                    <li>Conjunction: I have been busy <strong>since</strong> I started the new job.</li>
                    <li>Preposition: I have been busy <strong>since</strong> Monday.</li>
                    <li>Conjunction: He was sad <strong>for</strong> he had lost the game.</li>
                    <li>Preposition: This gift is <strong>for</strong> you.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>8. Parallel Structure Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> Conjunctions should join elements of the same grammatical structure. For example, an adverb should be joined with an adverb, not an adjective.</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>Correct: He worked busily <strong>and</strong> carefully. (adverb + adverb)</li>
                    <li>Incorrect: He worked busily <strong>and</strong> careful. (adverb + adjective)</li>
                    <li>Correct: She likes to swim <strong>and</strong> to hike. (infinitive + infinitive)</li>
                    <li>Incorrect: She likes swimming <strong>and</strong> to hike. (gerund + infinitive)</li>
                    <li>Correct: The movie was exciting <strong>but</strong> long. (adjective + adjective)</li>
                    <li>Correct: He is a man of great wealth <strong>and</strong> of great influence. (phrase + phrase)</li>
                    <li>Correct: You can pay by cash <strong>or</strong> by card. (phrase + phrase)</li>
                    <li>Correct: She is not only beautiful <strong>but also</strong> intelligent. (adjective + adjective)</li>
                    <li>Correct: He decided to study hard <strong>and</strong> to stop wasting time. (infinitive + infinitive)</li>
                    <li>Correct: The report was written clearly <strong>and</strong> concisely. (adverb + adverb)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>9. Extra Technique: The "Relationship Question" Test</h3>
                <p><strong>Easy Explanation:</strong> A conjunction often introduces the answer to a "relationship question" about the other part of the sentence. Ask: *Why? When? Under what condition? What is the result?*</p>
                <ol class="example-list">
                    <li>Sentence: He was upset <strong>because</strong> he lost the game. (Why was he upset?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: I will go <strong>if</strong> it stops raining. (Under what condition will I go?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: She is smart, <strong>but</strong> she is lazy. (What is the contrast to her being smart?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: It was late, <strong>so</strong> we went home. (What was the result of it being late?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: He put on his coat <strong>and</strong> left the house. (He put on his coat, and then what?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: We must leave now, <strong>or</strong> we will be late. (What is the alternative?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: I'll call you <strong>when</strong> I arrive. (When will I call you?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: He is a good leader, <strong>for</strong> he is fair to everyone. (Why is he a good leader?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: <strong>Although</strong> the test was difficult, I passed. (What is the contrast to the test being difficult?)</li>
                    <li>Sentence: He ran fast, <strong>yet</strong> he missed the train. (What is the surprising result of him running fast?)</li>
